In cosmology, **flatness** refers to the observation that the large-scale spatial geometry of the universe is very nearly Euclidean rather than positively or negatively curved.

## Geometric meaning

The curvature of space determines how geometry behaves on cosmic scales:

- In a **flat** universe, standard Euclidean rules hold: the angles of a large triangle sum to $180°$, and parallel light rays maintain constant separation over cosmic distances.
- In a **positively curved** universe (spherical geometry), large triangles have angle sums exceeding $180°$, and initially parallel light rays eventually converge.
- In a **negatively curved** universe (saddle-like geometry), large triangles have angle sums less than $180°$, and parallel rays diverge.

## Density and critical density

Flatness is determined by the total energy density of the universe. The Friedmann equations define a **critical density** $\rho_c$ that separates the three geometric cases:

| Condition | Curvature parameter | Geometry |
|---|---|---|
| $\rho = \rho_c$ | $k = 0$ | Flat (Euclidean) |
| $\rho > \rho_c$ | $k > 0$ | Closed (positively curved) |
| $\rho < \rho_c$ | $k < 0$ | Open (negatively curved) |

The **density parameter** $\Omega$ is defined as

$$\Omega = \frac{\rho}{\rho_c}$$

Flatness corresponds to $\Omega = 1$.

## Observational evidence

Measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies — most precisely by the Planck satellite — show that $\Omega$ is extremely close to $1$. The observable universe is flat to within roughly one percent. This near-exact flatness over $13.8$ billion years gives rise to the **flatness problem**: in standard Big Bang cosmology without inflation, flatness is an unstable equilibrium. Any deviation from $\Omega = 1$ grows rapidly with time, so $\Omega$ must have been extraordinarily fine-tuned to unity in the very early universe.

**Cosmic inflation** resolves this problem. A brief period of exponential expansion in the early universe drives $\Omega$ toward $1$ regardless of its initial value, much as inflating a balloon makes its surface appear flat locally.

## Intuitive picture

A common analogy involves two laser beams launched in parallel. In a flat universe they remain parallel indefinitely. In a positively curved universe the beams slowly converge, and in a negatively curved universe they drift apart. On small scales, spacetime can still be curved by local masses (gravity), but flatness refers to the large-scale average geometry of space itself.
