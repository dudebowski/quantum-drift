## Particle physics: beyond the SM

- **Supersymmetry (SUSY)**: Extends the Standard Model (SM) by pairing every known particle with a heavier superpartner; includes concrete models like the MSSM and NMSSM.
  
- **Grand Unified Theories (GUTs)**: Unify the strong, weak and electromagnetic forces in a single gauge group (e.g. SU(5), SO(10)), often predicting proton decay and new heavy gauge bosons.​
  
- **String theory / M‑theory**: Replaces point particles with 1D strings (and higher‑dimensional branes), naturally living in extra spatial dimensions and aiming to include gravity and the SM in one quantum framework.
  
- **Extra dimensions & brane-worlds**: Models where our visible universe is a 3+1‑dimensional brane in a higher‑dimensional bulk (e.g. Kaluza–Klein, Randall–Sundrum), sometimes addressing hierarchy and dark energy.
    
- **Composite Higgs and technicolor**: Propose that the Higgs is not fundamental but a bound state from a new strong interaction, addressing naturalness of the Higgs mass.​
    
- **Neutrino mass models**: Seesaw mechanisms, sterile neutrinos, and Majorana neutrinos to explain tiny but nonzero neutrino masses beyond the SM’s massless neutrino assumption.
  
- **Dark matter candidates**: WIMPs (often SUSY), axions, sterile neutrinos and other hidden‑sector particles introduced to account for astrophysical dark matter.
      
- **Baryogenesis and leptogenesis models**: Mechanisms beyond the SM CP violation to explain the observed matter–antimatter asymmetry in the universe.
    
- **Quantum gravity approaches**: Loop quantum gravity and related models as non‑string attempts to quantize spacetime and unify with quantum field theory.

## Cosmology: beyond ΛCDM

- **Dynamical dark energy**: Quintessence and related scalar‑field models replace a constant Λ with a field whose energy density evolves in time.
    
- **Modified gravity / MOND‑like ideas**: Models such as MOND and relativistic extensions change gravity at galactic or cosmological scales to explain phenomena usually attributed to dark matter or dark energy.

- **Inflation variants**: Chaotic inflation, ekpyrotic and cyclic models modify or replace standard single‑field inflation, changing early‑universe dynamics while often keeping a hot Big Bang aftermath.
  
- **Inhomogeneous and alternative expansion models**: Cold Big Bang, varying‑constants cosmologies, zero‑active‑mass ($R_h=ct$) Milne universe, and related scenarios alter assumptions like homogeneity or constant physical laws.
    
- **Non‑standard dark matter / dark energy sectors**: Self‑interacting dark matter, warm dark matter, early dark energy, or coupled dark sectors tweak ΛCDM’s matter and energy content.
