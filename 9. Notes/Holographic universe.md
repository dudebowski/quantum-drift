Juan Maldacena’s work is the standard modern realization of the **holographic universe** idea: the AdS/CFT correspondence, often just called “Maldacena duality.

## Core idea

- In 1997, Maldacena proposed that a certain quantum gravity theory in a curved “bulk” spacetime (anti–de Sitter space, AdS) is exactly equivalent (dual) to a quantum field theory without gravity living on the lower‑dimensional boundary of that spacetime.
    
- This is holographic because all physics in the higher‑dimensional volume can, in principle, be described completely by the lower‑dimensional theory, analogous to a 3D hologram encoded on a 2D surface.
## From black holes to holography

- Earlier work by ’t Hooft and Susskind showed that the entropy of a black hole scales with its surface area, not its volume, suggesting that the information content of a region is encoded on its boundary (the holographic principle).

- Maldacena gave the first sharp, mathematically precise realization of this principle with AdS/CFT, providing a concrete “universe in a bottle” where gravity in the bulk emerges from a non‑gravitational quantum theory on the boundary.

## What AdS/CFT actually says

- The duality: a string or gravity theory in a (d+1)(d+1)(d+1)-dimensional AdS spacetime is equivalent to a conformal field theory (CFT) living on its ddd-dimensional boundary.
    
- Every bulk field configuration (e.g., a star, black hole, or perturbation of spacetime) corresponds to some pattern of quantum excitations in the boundary CFT, and vice versa; correlation functions, spectra, and even black‑hole thermodynamics match under the duality.
    
- This gives a non‑perturbative definition of certain string theories and a fully consistent example of a quantum theory of gravity.
## Implications for “our” universe

- Maldacena’s original model lives in AdS, which is not the geometry of our observed universe (which is closer to de Sitter space with positive cosmological constant).
    
- Physicists are exploring holographic descriptions of more realistic cosmologies (e.g., de Sitter holography), but a complete, widely accepted holographic dual for our universe does not yet exist.
    
- Still, AdS/CFT has become a powerful **toy model** for thinking about emergent spacetime and quantum gravity, and it strongly suggests that spacetime geometry and gravity might emerge from entanglement patterns in an underlying lower‑dimensional quantum system.
    
## How “literal” is the hologram?

- In Maldacena’s setup, the statement “the universe is a hologram” means: all physical observables in the bulk gravitational theory can be encoded and computed in the boundary CFT, with no loss of information.
    
- Whether our actual cosmos is described by some (as‑yet unknown) holographic dual is an open question; AdS/CFT is extremely well‑tested as a conjecture in its own regime, but extrapolating it to our universe is speculative.
