# Cosmology and Quatum Gravity

Quantum field theory (QFT) of gravity and more general quantum gravity ideas enter cosmology mainly when classical general relativity breaks down: very early in the Big Bang, near singularities, and for the origin of cosmic structure and dark‑energy–like effects. In “ordinary” late‑time cosmology you mostly use QFT **on** a curved spacetime, while full quantum gravity tries to describe the spacetime itself quantum mechanically and then ask what that implies for the universe as a whole.

## Three levels: GR, QFT, quantum gravity

- Classical cosmology uses general relativity (GR) to model an expanding homogeneous universe plus classical matter and radiation; this works very well for large scales and late times.
- Quantum field theory in curved spacetime treats matter fields (like the inflaton) quantum mechanically on a fixed GR background, which already explains inflation and the generation of primordial fluctuations that seed galaxies.
- A full quantum theory of gravity (loop quantum gravity, string theory, group field theory, etc.) tries to quantize the geometry itself and is expected to change the physics at Planckian curvatures, such as the Big Bang and black‑hole interiors.

## QFT in curved spacetime and cosmology

- In standard inflationary cosmology, one quantizes a scalar field on an expanding FLRW background; vacuum fluctuations stretched by expansion become the nearly scale‑invariant perturbations seen in the CMB and large‑scale structure.
- This framework is not a full quantum gravity theory because the spacetime metric is treated classically, but it provides a controlled “bridge regime” where quantum fields feel curvature and backreaction is small.

## Quantum gravity and early‑universe cosmology

- When curvature and energy density approach the Planck scale (backward extrapolation to the Big Bang), classical GR predicts a singularity where densities diverge and the theory fails; quantum gravity is expected to resolve or replace this singularity.
- Concrete approaches, like loop quantum cosmology (derived from loop quantum gravity) and some group field theory models, replace the initial singularity with a **bounce**, yielding a “Big Bounce” scenario and modified early‑time dynamics.

## Quantum gravity effects on observables

- Quantum‑gravity‑modified cosmologies can alter the primordial power spectrum, produce non‑Gaussianities, or generate relics like cosmic strings or specific gravitational‑wave backgrounds that might be tested with CMB and GW observations.
- Some models also link quantum gravity to the effective cosmological constant or dark energy, for example via modified gravity or emergent‑gravity ideas where quantum microstructure of spacetime induces late‑time acceleration.

## Relation between “QFT of gravity” and “quantum gravity”

- Perturbative “QFT of gravity” treats gravity as a spin‑2 field on a fixed background; it is useful as an effective field theory at low energies but non‑renormalizable in the UV, so it needs completion.
- Full quantum gravity approaches (string theory, loop quantum gravity, etc.) aim to be UV‑complete and background‑independent, then recover both GR and QFT in curved spacetime as low‑energy limits; cosmology is one of the main arenas where those limits and potential corrections can be confronted with data.
