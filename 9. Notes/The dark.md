Dark matter and dark energy both _involve_ quantum mechanics, but only dark energy currently has a relatively direct link through quantum field theory; in both cases, the connection is conceptually deep but technically unresolved. For dark matter, leading particle candidates are fundamentally quantum objects; for dark energy, the main idea is vacuum energy from quantum fields, which leads to the notorious cosmological constant problem
## Dark matter and quantum mechanics

- Many dark matter models assume a new quantum particle (WIMPs, axions, sterile neutrinos), described by quantum fields just like electrons or quarks, but interacting extremely weakly with the Standard Model.​
    
- Some proposals use explicitly quantum states, e.g. ultra‑light “fuzzy” dark matter modeled as a coherent Bose–Einstein condensate–like field, so its large‑scale behavior comes from one macroscopic quantum wavefunction.​
    

## Quantum gravity and dark matter

- In some quantum‑gravity‑motivated effective theories, extra massive spin‑2 or spin‑0 modes of the gravitational field itself can be long‑lived and behave as dark matter purely through gravity, without additional forces.
- New frameworks linking gravity to quantum information or entropy introduce additional gravitational fields (like the proposed “G‑field”) that could mimic dark matter’s extra gravity while arising from underlying quantum structure.

## Dark energy as vacuum energy

- A leading explanation of dark energy is a cosmological constant Λ, equivalent in Einstein’s equations to a uniform energy density of the vacuum; in quantum field theory, every field has zero‑point fluctuations that contribute such vacuum energy.​
    
- Naively summing quantum zero‑point energies gives a vacuum energy density many orders of magnitude larger than the observed dark energy density, which is the cosmological constant problem: why the quantum vacuum gravitates so little compared with QFT estimates.​
    

## Beyond a pure cosmological constant

- Alternatives model dark energy as a slowly rolling quantum scalar field (“quintessence”), again treated within quantum field theory on curved spacetime, with dynamics tuned to produce late‑time acceleration​.
    
- Emergent or entropic gravity approaches try to derive both an effective cosmological constant and extra "dark" gravitational effects from underlying quantum or statistical properties of spacetime, potentially linking dark energy, dark matter, and quantum mechanics in a single framework, though these ideas are still speculative.​
