# Topics

A map of "second-layer" questions in quantum mechanics, quantum gravity, and cosmology — beyond textbook basics, focused on conceptual edges and cross-cutting themes.

## Quantum foundations and interpretation

- Contextuality beyond Bell: Kochen–Specker theorem and "value definiteness" in realistic models.
- The measurement problem as a dynamical question: models of spontaneous collapse (GRW/CSL) versus decoherence-only accounts.
- Quantum Darwinism and einselection as a story about "emergent classicality" rather than just environment-induced decoherence.
- $\psi$-ontology vs $\psi$-epistemology: what PBR-type arguments actually exclude and what they leave open.
- Superdeterminism as a serious proposal: what a non-conspiratorial superdeterministic model would look like.
- Retrocausal and two-time formalisms in quantum theory (Aharonov's two-state vector, time-symmetric approaches).
- Operational vs ontological frameworks: generalized probabilistic theories and "how quantum is quantum?" questions.

## Mathematical structures behind quantum theory

- C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras as the "true home" of observables, especially in QFT.
- Category-theoretic quantum mechanics: monoidal categories and diagrammatic tensor-network style reasoning.
- Positive-operator-valued measures (POVMs) and instruments as the natural language of real measurements.
- Symmetry, representation theory, and superselection sectors beyond simple $SU(2)$ spin.
- Quantum information geometry: Fisher information metric, Bures distance, and "curved" state space.
- Non-Hermitian and PT-symmetric Hamiltonians as effective descriptions and what "probability" means there.

## Quantum field theory beyond the standard introduction

- The Wilsonian renormalization group as "theory space" dynamics rather than a technical trick.
- Effective field theory as a philosophy: when a theory is "good enough" without being UV-complete.
- Infrared problems and soft theorems: why QED and gravity have such awkward IR structure.
- The algebraic/QFT-on-curved-spacetime point of view: local algebras instead of particles.
- Gauge fixing and BRST symmetry interpreted cohomologically instead of as pure formalism.
- Anomalies as obstructions to gauging symmetries and how this constrains possible theories.

## Quantum gravity: conceptual edges

- Background independence as a constraint on quantum theory, not just a property of GR.
- The problem of time in canonical quantum gravity: frozen Wheeler–DeWitt equation and relational time.
- Holography as a statement about redundancy of bulk data, not only AdS/CFT as a specific duality.
- Entanglement wedge reconstruction: how spacetime regions map to boundary operator algebras.
- The Page curve and the island formula as hints about the microscopic structure of spacetime.
- Discrete vs continuum: causal sets, spin foams, and tensor models as rival "atoms of spacetime."
- Gravity-as-entanglement proposals: Ryu–Takayanagi as geometry = entanglement entropy.

## Cosmology and the dark sector

- Inflation as an effective field theory: decoupling details of the inflaton potential from observables.
- Alternatives to inflation (ekpyrotic, bouncing models) and what observational "smoking guns" would distinguish them.
- $\Lambda$ as vacuum energy vs $\Lambda$ as an emergent parameter: sequestering, anthropic, and modified gravity views.
- Dark matter as a field: ultralight axions, fuzzy DM, and wave interference in galactic cores.
- "Small-scale crisis" of ΛCDM and baryonic feedback vs exotic dark sector explanations.
- Dark energy as modified gravity: $f(R)$, scalar–tensor, massive gravity, and strong-field tests.
- Cosmic neutrino background and light relics as precision probes of early-universe physics.

## Quantum information meets spacetime

- Complexity as a possible "bulk volume" or "action" dual in holography.
- Quantum error-correcting codes as toy models for the bulk–boundary map.
- Entanglement phase transitions in random circuits vs black hole information recovery.
- Quantum reference frames and how they change the description of localisation and superposition.
- Resource theories of asymmetry and their relation to time translation and thermodynamics.

## Non-equilibrium, open systems, and cosmology

- Open quantum systems as a framework for early-universe decoherence and classical perturbations.
- Quantum thermodynamics in expanding spacetimes: how to define work and heat in cosmology.
- Fluctuation theorems and their possible analogues in semiclassical gravity.
- Stochastic gravity: treating the stress-energy tensor as noisy and its effect on metric fluctuations.

## Less standard connecting topics

- Emergent symmetries and "accidental" conservation laws in cosmology and particle physics.
- Dualities outside AdS/CFT: Kramers–Wannier, particle–vortex, and their conceptual role.
- Topological phases of matter as analogues for exotic spacetime topology or gauge structure.
- Tensor networks (MERA, PEPS) as discrete toy universes with controllable entanglement geometry.
- Information-theoretic derivations of quantum theory and/or Einstein equations from axioms.
