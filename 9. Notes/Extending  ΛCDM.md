# Extending ΛCDM

Two speculative programmes — Erik Verlinde's emergent gravity and Thomas Hertog's quantum cosmology — attempt to explain what the standard ΛCDM model puts in by hand. Neither is simply philosophical gloss; both are alternative frameworks that modify or extend the ΛCDM picture and aim at in-principle testable predictions.

## Erik Verlinde: emergent gravity and the dark universe

Verlinde proposes that spacetime and gravity are **emergent** phenomena arising from microscopic quantum-information and entanglement degrees of freedom. Gravity behaves as an entropic or elastic response of this underlying medium.

Key ingredients:
- In de Sitter–like universes the cosmological horizon carries entropy with not only an area-law term but also a **volume-law** contribution that becomes important at large scales.
- The competition between area- and volume-law entanglement produces an extra "dark" gravitational force mimicking the effects usually attributed to dark matter, governed by an acceleration scale $a_0 \sim cH_0$ — similar to MOND.

### Relation to ΛCDM

- At a practical level, Verlinde's framework aims to reproduce the same large-scale phenomenology as ΛCDM (galaxy rotation curves, cluster dynamics, cosmic acceleration) with no particle dark matter and a different underlying mechanism for dark energy.
- At a conceptual level, the programme targets exactly the dark-matter and dark-energy sectors that ΛCDM treats as free parameters, attempting to derive them from quantum-gravity and entanglement physics.
- The framework makes testable predictions (e.g. specific relations between baryonic mass and "dark" gravity) but is currently less developed than ΛCDM and faces mixed empirical success.

Emergent gravity is best viewed as an **alternative effective description** that aims to reduce $\Lambda$ and CDM to collective phenomena — analogous to deriving elasticity from atomic physics — rather than changing the observed cosmology itself.

## Thomas Hertog (with Hawking): quantum cosmology

Hertog and Hawking developed a programme in **quantum cosmology** using string theory, holography, and [[Holographic universe|holographic]] approaches to describe the early universe and inflation.

Key ideas:
- The usual picture of **eternal inflation** leads to an infinite fractal multiverse of pocket universes with widely varying physical laws — a framework that is difficult to test.
- Hertog and Hawking propose instead that the universe emerging from inflation is **finite and reasonably smooth** on the largest scales, with a significantly reduced multiverse. This makes the theory more predictive and in principle testable via primordial gravitational waves and CMB signatures.

### Relation to ΛCDM

- Hertog's work does not replace ΛCDM's late-time dynamics. It aims to provide a **quantum-gravitational origin** for the initial conditions and possibly for inflation and dark energy (e.g. emergent de Sitter phases in certain quantum-gravity models).
- ΛCDM is kept as an effective description of the large-scale universe; the deeper theory explains *why* those parameters and large-scale properties (finite, smooth, approximately de Sitter) take the values they do.
- Observational handles include primordial gravitational waves and detailed CMB pattern predictions, though this remains speculative and under development.

## Summary

| Programme | Strategy | Relation to ΛCDM |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Verlinde** (emergent gravity) | Replace dark matter; reinterpret dark energy as collective entanglement phenomena | **Alternative/competing** — targets the dark sector |
| **Hertog** (quantum cosmology) | Provide a quantum-gravitational origin for initial conditions and inflation | **Foundational/complementary** — leaves ΛCDM as the effective late-time description |
