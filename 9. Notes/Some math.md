# Do the math

The core mathematical backbone of quantum physics is **linear algebra**, functional analysis, [[Tensors|tensors]], Hilbert spaces, and group/Lie algebra theory.

## Quantum physics: main mathematics

Besides tensors, the core mathematical backbone of quantum physics is built from **linear algebra**, Hilbert spaces, functional analysis, and group/Lie algebra theory.

### Linear algebra and Hilbert spaces

- Quantum states are vectors in a complex Hilbert space (a complete inner‑product vector space), and observables are linear operators on that space.
- Superposition, inner products, orthonormal bases, eigenvalues/eigenvectors, and unitary operators are all linear‑algebra concepts that become the language of quantum states, measurements, and time evolution.

### Functional analysis and operators

- Many observables (like position and momentum) are represented by unbounded self‑adjoint operators on infinite‑dimensional Hilbert spaces, so quantum theory leans heavily on functional analysis.
- The spectral theorem, domains of operators, and operator algebras underpin rigorous treatments of measurements, continuous spectra, and the Born rule.

### Complex analysis and measure theory


- Wave functions live in spaces like $L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$ , so measure and integration theory are needed to define norms, probabilities, and Fourier transforms between position and momentum space.
- Complex analysis supports propagators, contour integrals, and analytic continuation in scattering theory and quantum field theory.

### Group theory and Lie algebras

- Symmetries in quantum physics are described by Lie groups such as as rotations $SO(3)$ and unitary groups $SU(2)$, $SU(3)$, with their Lie algebras controlling generators like angular momentum operator
- Representation theory of these groups explains spin, particle multiplets, selection rules, and the structure of the Standard Model’s gauge symmetries.

### Probability and operator‑valued measures

- Quantum measurement theory generalises classical probability using projection‑valued and positive‑operator‑valued measures on Hilbert space.
- This blends probability theory with operator theory to define outcome distributions and state updates.

At a high level, the mathematical backbone of cosmology is differential geometry (for spacetime), plus field theory and dynamical systems (for matter, dark matter, and dark energy).

## Cosmology: main mathematics

### Geometry of spacetime

- Cosmology starts from **general relativity**, which models spacetime as a 4‑dimensional Lorentzian manifold with curvature described by Riemannian geometry and [[Tensors|tensors]].
- The standard large‑scale models use the **Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW)** metric, leading to the Friedmann equations that relate expansion rate, curvature, and energy content.

### ΛCDM and dark components

- The current standard model, **ΛCDM**, is a set of coupled differential equations on this FLRW background, with terms for radiation, baryonic matter, cold dark matter, and a cosmological constant Λ representing dark energy.
- Dark matter and dark energy enter mathematically through their energy–momentum tensors and equations of state in Einstein’s field equations and the Friedmann equations.

### Dark matter modeling

- On large scales, dark matter is treated as a cold, pressureless fluid, governed by the collisionless Boltzmann (Vlasov) equation plus Poisson/Einstein equations; this uses partial differential equations, statistical mechanics, and N‑body dynamics.
- More detailed models use scalar fields or other fields on curved spacetime, bringing in classical and quantum field theory on an FLRW background.

### Dark energy and dynamical systems

- For a cosmological constant, dark energy is just a constant term in Einstein’s equations; for dynamical dark energy (for example quintessence), one adds scalar fields with a potential, leading to coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equation systems.
- These are often analysed with dynamical systems theory (phase‑space analysis, fixed points, stability) to classify possible cosmic histories and late‑time behaviour.

### Observational and statistical layer

- Connecting theory to data (CMB, supernovae, galaxy surveys) relies on statistics and Bayesian inference, fitting the parameters of the ΛCDM or extended models.
- This uses likelihood functions built from the theoretical power spectra and distance–redshift relations derived from the FRW and perturbation equations.
