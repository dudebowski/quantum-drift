## Core weird principles

- **Superposition**: A quantum system can be in several possible states at once (e.g. “here” and “there”), with measurement picking one outcome according to probabilities given by the wavefunction.
- **Interference**: Because states are wave‑like, different possibilities can add or cancel, giving the double‑slit pattern and all the classic “fringes” you see in quantum demos.
- **Uncertainty principle**: Certain pairs (position–momentum, energy–time) cannot both be sharply defined; this is a structural property of quantum states, not just bad instruments.

## Phenomena like entanglement/tunneling

- **Entanglement**: Two or more particles share one joint state so that measuring one instantly fixes correlations with the other, even if they are far apart.
- **Tunneling**: A particle has a non‑zero chance to appear across a classically forbidden barrier, underlying things like alpha decay and the scanning tunneling microscope.
- **Quantum nonlocality & Bell’s theorem**: Experiments show entangled correlations cannot be explained by any local hidden‑variable model, forcing a genuinely nonclassical picture of reality.

## How quantum becomes classical

- **Measurement problem**: The formalism has smooth unitary evolution plus sudden “collapse” on measurement, raising the question of what counts as a measurement and why outcomes are definite.
- **Decoherence**: Interaction with the environment rapidly destroys delicate superpositions, making the system look like a classical probabilistic mixture and explaining why we do not see macroscopic cats in obvious superpositions.

## Good next concepts to add

- **Wave–particle duality & double‑slit experiment**: How a single photon or electron produces an interference pattern over time.
- **Quantization & the Schrödinger equation**: Discrete energy levels and the basic rule that tells a wavefunction how to evolve in time.
- **Quantum information ideas**: Qubits, no‑cloning, quantum teleportation, and why entanglement + superposition give computational and cryptographic advantages.
