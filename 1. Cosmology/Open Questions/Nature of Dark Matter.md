# The Nature of Dark Matter

Dark matter makes up ~26% of the universe's energy budget and is the dominant gravitational driver of structure formation, yet its particle identity is unknown. Determining what dark matter is made of is one of the central open problems in the [[Standard model of cosmology|ΛCDM model]] and in particle physics.

## Known properties

The evidence for dark matter is overwhelming (see [[Cold Dark Matter]]), but it is entirely gravitational. Dark matter:
- Does not emit, absorb, or scatter light (or does so negligibly)
- Is "cold" — non-relativistic at the time structures formed
- Is "collisionless" — dark matter particles do not significantly scatter off each other or off baryons
- Has a total density $\Omega_c \approx 0.26$ (see [[Density Parameters]])

Beyond these properties, ΛCDM says nothing about what dark matter actually is.

## Particle candidates

### WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles)
- Mass: ~1 GeV to ~100 TeV
- Interact via the weak force (or something similarly weak)
- The "WIMP miracle": a thermal relic with weak-scale interactions naturally gives the right abundance ($\Omega_c \approx 0.25$)
- Decades of direct detection experiments (LUX, XENON, PandaX, LZ) have not found WIMPs, pushing limits on their interaction cross-section to very small values

### Axions
- Originally proposed to solve the strong CP problem in QCD
- Mass: $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-3}$ eV (classical axion window)
- Produced non-thermally in the early universe, forming a coherent, cold condensate
- Experiments: ADMX, ABRACADABRA, CASPEr are searching for axion-photon conversion in magnetic fields

### Sterile neutrinos
- Hypothetical neutrinos that do not participate in weak interactions
- Mass: keV scale (warm dark matter candidate)
- Could be detected through X-ray line emission from their decay
- Constraints are tightening; some claimed signals (e.g. the 3.5 keV line) remain controversial

### Ultra-light / fuzzy dark matter
- Extremely light bosons ($m \sim 10^{-22}$ eV) behaving as a coherent quantum wave on galactic scales
- The de Broglie wavelength is ~kpc, suppressing small-scale structure
- Motivated by string theory (many light scalar fields predicted)
- See [[The dark|Dark Matter and Dark Energy]] for the quantum perspective

## Detection strategies

| Approach | Method | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **Direct detection** | Look for dark matter scattering off nuclei in underground labs | No confirmed signal; limits improving steadily |
| **Indirect detection** | Search for products of dark matter annihilation/decay (gamma rays, neutrinos, positrons) | Some excesses debated; no conclusive signal |
| **Collider production** | Produce dark matter at the LHC or future colliders | No missing-energy signals beyond the Standard Model |
| **Astrophysical probes** | Small-scale structure, halo shapes, self-interactions | Constraints on warm/self-interacting models |

## Alternatives to particle dark matter

### Modified gravity (MOND)
- Modified Newtonian Dynamics: changes the law of gravity at low accelerations to explain galaxy rotation curves without dark matter
- Struggles with galaxy clusters, CMB, and structure formation
- Relativistic extensions (TeVeS) exist but face challenges

### Gravitational dark matter
- In some quantum gravity approaches, extra modes of the gravitational field itself could mimic dark matter. See [[9. Notes/Quantum gravity|Cosmology and Quantum Gravity]].
- Emergent gravity proposals suggest dark matter effects arise from quantum information properties of spacetime
