# Beyond ΛCDM

The [[Standard model of cosmology|ΛCDM model]] is remarkably successful, but it is widely expected to be an effective description rather than the final word. Several observational tensions and theoretical puzzles motivate the search for extensions and alternatives.

## Why look beyond ΛCDM?

### Observational tensions
- **[[Hubble Tension]]**: the ~5σ discrepancy between early- and late-universe measurements of $H_0$ is the most pressing challenge to ΛCDM.
- **$S_8$ tension**: some weak-lensing and galaxy-clustering measurements find less clumping of matter than ΛCDM + Planck predicts (at ~2–3σ). This could signal suppressed structure growth.
- **DESI BAO hints**: early DESI results suggest possible evolution in the dark energy equation of state ($w(z) \neq -1$), though not yet at decisive significance.

### Theoretical puzzles
- **Cosmological constant problem**: why is $\Lambda$ ~$10^{120}$ times smaller than the QFT vacuum energy estimate? See [[Nature of Dark Energy]].
- **Coincidence problem**: why are $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$ comparable today?
- **Inflation**: ΛCDM assumes inflation but does not explain its mechanism or origin. See [[Cosmic Inflation]].
- **Nature of dark matter and dark energy**: ΛCDM parameterises them but does not identify them. See [[Nature of Dark Matter]] and [[Nature of Dark Energy]].

## Proposed extensions

### Dynamical dark energy
Replace $\Lambda$ with a time-varying component:
- **Quintessence**: a scalar field with $w(z) > -1$ that evolves over cosmic time
- **$w_0 w_a$CDM**: a phenomenological parameterisation $w(a) = w_0 + w_a(1-a)$ that allows data to constrain dark energy evolution
- Current data: consistent with $w = -1$ but with room for small deviations

### Early dark energy
A brief episode of dark energy before recombination that:
- Increases the early expansion rate
- Shrinks the sound horizon
- Shifts the CMB-inferred $H_0$ upward, potentially resolving the Hubble tension
- Must "turn off" quickly to avoid disrupting CMB and structure formation

### Modified gravity
Instead of dark energy, modify general relativity on cosmological scales:
- $f(R)$ gravity, Horndeski theories, massive gravity
- Must pass stringent solar-system and gravitational-wave tests
- Could also affect structure growth, potentially addressing the $S_8$ tension

### Interacting dark sector
Allow dark matter and dark energy to exchange energy:
- Can modify the expansion history and growth of structure
- Adds new parameters but no clear theoretical motivation yet

### Warm or self-interacting dark matter
- **Warm dark matter** (e.g. keV sterile neutrinos): suppresses small-scale structure, potentially solving the "missing satellites" and "cusp-core" problems
- **Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM)**: dark matter particles scatter off each other, creating cored density profiles in halos

### Bouncing cosmologies
From quantum gravity approaches (loop quantum cosmology, group field theory):
- Replace the Big Bang singularity with a **bounce** — the universe contracts and re-expands
- Can reproduce inflation's successes (flatness, horizon, perturbation spectrum) without an inflaton field
- See [[9. Notes/Quantum gravity|Cosmology and Quantum Gravity]] for more on quantum gravity and cosmology

## How to test

| Probe | What it constrains |
|-------|-------------------|
| **CMB-S4** | Primordial gravitational waves ($r$), $N_{\text{eff}}$, neutrino masses |
| **DESI** | $w(z)$ from BAO at multiple redshifts |
| **Rubin/LSST** | Dark energy via SNe Ia + weak lensing |
| **Euclid** | Growth of structure + geometric expansion |
| **LISA** | Gravitational wave background from inflation or phase transitions |
| **21-cm cosmology** | The dark ages and cosmic dawn, new window on early-universe physics |
