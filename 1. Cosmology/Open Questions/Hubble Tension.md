# The Hubble Tension

The Hubble tension is a persistent and statistically significant disagreement between two ways of measuring the [[Hubble Constant]] $H_0$: one from the early universe (via the [[Cosmic Microwave Background]]) and one from the late universe (via the cosmic distance ladder). At ~5σ, it is the most prominent "crack" in the [[Standard model of cosmology|ΛCDM model]] and may hint at new physics.

## The numbers

| Method                                | $H_0$ (km/s/Mpc) | Source                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Planck CMB (early universe)           | $67.4 \pm 0.5$   | ΛCDM fit to CMB data          |
| SH0ES distance ladder (late universe) | $73.0 \pm 1.0$   | Cepheids + Type Ia supernovae |

The ~8% discrepancy corresponds to a ~5σ tension — far beyond what can be attributed to statistical fluctuations.

## Why it matters

If both measurements are correct, **ΛCDM is incomplete**. The model predicts a single consistent value of $H_0$: the CMB data, run forward through the ΛCDM expansion history, should give the same $H_0$ that local measurements find. The fact that they disagree implies either:
1. An unrecognised systematic error in one or both measurements, or
2. New physics beyond ΛCDM that modifies the expansion history

## Could it be a measurement error?

### Early-universe side
- The Planck $H_0$ is derived assuming ΛCDM is correct — if the model is wrong, so is this number.
- However, independent early-universe probes (BAO + BBN, ACT CMB) give similar low values.

### Late-universe side
- The SH0ES measurement uses a calibration chain: geometric parallax → Cepheids → [[Type Ia Supernovae]]. Each step has been scrutinised extensively.
- Alternative distance indicators (TRGB) give intermediate values (~69–70), which may or may not alleviate the tension depending on the analysis.
- The JWST has confirmed and refined Cepheid measurements, strengthening the case for the higher local value.

The persistence of the tension across multiple independent measurements on both sides makes a simple systematic error increasingly unlikely.

## Possible new physics

If the tension is real, something must change the expansion rate between the CMB epoch ($z \approx 1100$) and today. Proposals include:

### Early-time solutions
- **Early dark energy**: a brief burst of dark energy before recombination that increases the early expansion rate, shrinks the sound horizon, and shifts the inferred $H_0$ upward.
- **Extra relativistic species**: increasing $N_{\text{eff}}$ beyond 3.044 speeds up early expansion.
- **Modified recombination**: changes to the physics of recombination could shift the CMB-derived $H_0$.

### Late-time solutions
- **Evolving dark energy**: $w \neq -1$ or time-varying dark energy that modifies the late expansion history.
- **Interacting dark sector**: dark matter and dark energy exchanging energy.
- **Modified gravity**: deviations from general relativity at late times.

No single proposal has yet convincingly resolved the tension without creating new problems elsewhere.

## Current status

The Hubble tension remains unresolved. Ongoing and future observations that will shed light:
- **JWST**: refining the Cepheid distance ladder
- **DESI**: precision BAO measurements across cosmic time
- **Gravitational wave standard sirens**: completely independent $H_0$ from binary mergers
- **CMB-S4**: next-generation CMB measurements

## Connections

- [[Hubble Constant]] — the parameter at the centre of the tension
- [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] — the early-universe $H_0$ measurement
- [[Type Ia Supernovae]] — the backbone of the late-universe distance ladder
- [[Dark Energy]] — modifications could resolve the tension
- [[Beyond ΛCDM]] — the tension motivates extensions of the standard model
