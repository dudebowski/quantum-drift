# The Nature of Dark Energy

Dark energy drives the accelerated expansion of the universe and accounts for ~69% of its energy budget, yet its fundamental nature is unknown. This is one of the deepest open questions in the [[Standard model of cosmology|ΛCDM model]] and in all of physics.

## The problem

In ΛCDM, [[Dark Energy]] is modelled as the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ — a constant energy density filling all of space with equation of state $w = -1$. This fits all current observations. But it raises profound questions:

### Why this value?
The observed dark energy density is:

$$\rho_\Lambda \approx 6 \times 10^{-27}\,\text{kg/m}^3$$

This is an extraordinarily small number by particle physics standards.

### The cosmological constant problem
In quantum field theory, the vacuum energy of all fields contributes to $\Lambda$. Naive estimates give:

$$\rho_{\text{vacuum}}^{\text{QFT}} \sim 10^{120}\,\rho_\Lambda^{\text{observed}}$$

This ~120 orders of magnitude discrepancy is the **cosmological constant problem** — the worst prediction in the history of physics. Either the vacuum energy is cancelled by some unknown mechanism to an extraordinary precision, or our understanding of how vacuum energy gravitates is fundamentally wrong.

See [[The dark|Dark Matter and Dark Energy]] for the QFT perspective.

### The coincidence problem
Why is $\Omega_\Lambda \approx \Omega_m$ today? Dark energy is constant while matter dilutes as $a^{-3}$, so they are comparable only during a brief cosmic epoch — and we happen to live in it. Is this a coincidence, or does it point to a deeper connection?

## Alternatives to $\Lambda$

### Quintessence
A slowly rolling scalar field $\phi$ with a potential $V(\phi)$, similar to the inflaton but active at late times:
- Gives a time-varying $w(z)$ that can differ from $-1$
- Can potentially address the coincidence problem through "tracking" solutions
- Introduces new free functions ($V(\phi)$) that must be constrained by data

### Phantom dark energy
Models with $w < -1$, which lead to a "Big Rip" — the scale factor diverging in finite time. Theoretically problematic (ghost instabilities) but not observationally excluded.

### Modified gravity
Instead of adding dark energy to general relativity, one can modify gravity itself on cosmological scales:
- $f(R)$ gravity: replacing the Einstein-Hilbert action with a general function of the Ricci scalar
- DGP braneworld models: extra-dimensional modifications to gravity
- These must reproduce GR's successes on solar system and smaller scales

### Emergent/entropic approaches
Some approaches try to derive an effective cosmological constant from quantum properties of spacetime:
- Emergent gravity: $\Lambda$ arises from the entropy and information content of spacetime
- These are speculative but attempt to connect dark energy to quantum gravity. See [[9. Notes/Quantum gravity|Cosmology and Quantum Gravity]].

## Observational tests

The key observable is the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ and its evolution:

- **$w = -1$ exactly** (constant): consistent with $\Lambda$
- **$w \neq -1$ or time-varying**: signals dynamical dark energy

Current and upcoming experiments:
- **DESI** (BAO): first results suggest possible $w(z)$ evolution, though not yet conclusive
- **Rubin/LSST** (supernovae + weak lensing): will map the expansion history with unprecedented precision
- **Euclid** (galaxy clustering + lensing): designed to constrain $w(z)$ to percent level
- **Roman Space Telescope** (supernovae + BAO): complementary dark energy constraints
