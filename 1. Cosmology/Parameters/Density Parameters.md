# Density Parameters

The density parameters $\Omega_i$ are dimensionless numbers that describe the fractional contribution of each component of the universe to the total energy budget. Together with the [[Hubble Constant]] $H_0$, they fully specify the [[Standard model of cosmology|ΛCDM model]].

## Definition

Each density parameter is the ratio of the actual energy density of a component to the **critical density**:

$$\Omega_i = \frac{\rho_i}{\rho_{\text{crit}}}$$

where the critical density is:

$$\rho_{\text{crit}} = \frac{3H_0^2}{8\pi G} \approx 9.5 \times 10^{-27}\,\text{kg/m}^3$$

This is the total energy density needed for a spatially flat universe ($k = 0$).

## The cosmic energy budget

From the first [[Friedmann Equations|Friedmann equation]], the density parameters must satisfy:

$$\Omega_r + \Omega_m + \Omega_\Lambda + \Omega_k = 1$$

where $\Omega_k = -kc^2/(a_0 H_0)^2$ represents spatial curvature.

### Present-day values (Planck 2018)

| Parameter | Symbol | Value | Component |
|-----------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Radiation | $\Omega_r$ | $\sim 9 \times 10^{-5}$ | Photons + relativistic neutrinos |
| Baryonic matter | $\Omega_b$ | $0.049$ | Protons, neutrons, electrons |
| Cold dark matter | $\Omega_c$ | $0.264$ | Non-baryonic dark matter |
| Total matter | $\Omega_m = \Omega_b + \Omega_c$ | $0.315$ | All non-relativistic matter |
| Dark energy | $\Omega_\Lambda$ | $0.685$ | Cosmological constant |
| Curvature | $\Omega_k$ | $\approx 0$ | Spatial flatness |

The universe is dominated by [[Dark Energy]] (~69%), followed by [[Cold Dark Matter]] (~26%), with [[Baryonic Matter]] (~5%) and [[Radiation and Neutrinos|radiation]] (negligible today) making up the rest.

## How density parameters are measured

Different observations are sensitive to different combinations of $\Omega$ values:

- **[[Cosmic Microwave Background]]**: The CMB acoustic peaks constrain $\Omega_b h^2$ and $\Omega_c h^2$ to percent-level precision. The position of the first peak constrains $\Omega_k \approx 0$.
- **[[Big Bang Nucleosynthesis]]**: Primordial deuterium abundance constrains $\Omega_b h^2$ independently.
- **[[Type Ia Supernovae]]**: The luminosity distance–redshift relation constrains the combination $\Omega_m$ vs $\Omega_\Lambda$.
- **[[Large-Scale Structure]]**: BAO and galaxy clustering constrain $\Omega_m$ and the expansion history.

The power of ΛCDM lies in the **concordance**: all these independent probes agree on the same set of $\Omega$ values.

## Evolution with time

The $\Omega$ values change with cosmic epoch because each component dilutes differently:
- $\rho_r \propto a^{-4}$ (radiation)
- $\rho_m \propto a^{-3}$ (matter)
- $\rho_\Lambda = \text{const}$ (dark energy)

So in the early universe, radiation dominated ($\Omega_r \to 1$); during the middle epoch, matter dominated ($\Omega_m \to 1$); and today, dark energy dominates ($\Omega_\Lambda \to 1$). The present epoch happens to be near the transition from matter to dark energy domination.

## The notation $\Omega_x h^2$

Results are often quoted as $\Omega_x h^2$ where $h = H_0 / (100\,\text{km/s/Mpc})$. This combination is more directly measured by the CMB than $\Omega_x$ alone, because the CMB constrains physical densities independently of $H_0$.

## Connections

- [[Friedmann Equations]] — the $\Omega$ parameters enter the energy constraint
- [[Hubble Constant]] — defines $\rho_{\text{crit}}$ and hence all $\Omega$ values
- [[Dark Energy]] — $\Omega_\Lambda \approx 0.69$
- [[Cold Dark Matter]] — $\Omega_c \approx 0.26$
- [[Baryonic Matter]] — $\Omega_b \approx 0.05$
- [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] — primary measurement of $\Omega_b h^2$ and $\Omega_c h^2$
