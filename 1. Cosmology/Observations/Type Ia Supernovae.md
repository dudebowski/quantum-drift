# Type Ia Supernovae

Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf stars that serve as **standardisable candles** in cosmology. Their use as distance indicators led to the 1998 discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating — the observational foundation for [[Dark Energy]] in the [[Standard model of cosmology|ΛCDM model]].

## Why they are useful

A Type Ia supernova occurs when a carbon-oxygen white dwarf accretes enough mass to approach the Chandrasekhar limit (~1.4 solar masses) and undergoes thermonuclear detonation. Because the triggering mass is approximately the same each time, the peak luminosity is approximately the same.

More precisely, SNe Ia are **standardisable**: after correcting for the observed correlation between peak brightness and the width of the light curve (brighter supernovae fade more slowly — the "Phillips relation"), the scatter in absolute magnitude is reduced to ~0.15 mag, making them excellent distance indicators out to redshifts $z > 1$.

## The discovery of accelerated expansion

In 1998, two independent teams — the **Supernova Cosmology Project** and the **High-z Supernova Search Team** — measured distances to dozens of distant SNe Ia and found them to be fainter than expected in a matter-dominated, decelerating universe. The conclusion:

> The expansion of the universe is accelerating.

This requires a component with negative pressure ($w < -1/3$) dominating the energy budget today — the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ or some other form of dark energy. The discovery was awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics.

## How the measurement works

1. **Observe** a Type Ia supernova at redshift $z$ and measure its apparent brightness.
2. **Standardise** using the light-curve shape to determine the absolute luminosity.
3. **Calculate** the **luminosity distance** $d_L(z)$ from the ratio of absolute to apparent brightness.
4. **Compare** $d_L(z)$ to the prediction from the [[Friedmann Equations]] for different cosmologies.

In a universe with $\Omega_m \approx 0.3$ and $\Omega_\Lambda \approx 0.7$, distant supernovae are fainter (farther away) than they would be in a matter-only universe — consistent with late-time acceleration.

## The Hubble diagram

Plotting luminosity distance vs redshift for hundreds of SNe Ia produces the **Hubble diagram**, which:
- At low $z$: measures the [[Hubble Constant]] $H_0$ (the slope of $d_L$ vs $z$)
- At higher $z$: traces the expansion history and constrains $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$
- Combined with the [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] and [[Large-Scale Structure|BAO]], gives tight joint constraints on ΛCDM parameters

## Systematics and modern surveys

Key systematic uncertainties include:
- **Dust extinction**: interstellar dust reddens and dims supernovae
- **Evolution**: are SNe Ia at high redshift truly identical to nearby ones?
- **Host galaxy correlations**: SNe Ia in different galaxy types show small residual brightness offsets

Modern surveys (Pantheon+, DES, the upcoming Rubin/LSST) use hundreds to thousands of SNe Ia with careful systematics control to push dark energy constraints further.

## Connections

- [[Dark Energy]] — SNe Ia provided the first evidence for accelerated expansion
- [[Hubble Constant]] — local SNe Ia calibrate $H_0$ (the "distance ladder")
- [[Hubble Tension]] — the SN-calibrated $H_0$ disagrees with the CMB value
- [[Friedmann Equations]] — the theoretical framework for interpreting $d_L(z)$
- [[Density Parameters]] — SNe Ia constrain $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$
