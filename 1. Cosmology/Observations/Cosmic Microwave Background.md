# The Cosmic Microwave Background

The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is the thermal radiation left over from the epoch of recombination, about 380,000 years after the Big Bang. It is the single most powerful observational pillar of the [[Standard model of cosmology|ΛCDM model]], and its detailed measurement has turned cosmology into a precision science.

## What it is

When the universe cooled below ~3000 K, protons and electrons combined into neutral hydrogen atoms. Photons, which had been continuously scattering off free electrons, were suddenly free to travel unimpeded. Those photons have been streaming through space ever since, redshifted by the expansion from ~3000 K to a near-perfect blackbody at:

$$T_{\text{CMB}} = 2.7255 \pm 0.0006\,\text{K}$$

The CMB fills the entire sky and carries information about the state of the universe at $z \approx 1100$.

## Temperature anisotropies

The CMB is not perfectly uniform. Tiny temperature fluctuations — at the level of about $\Delta T / T \sim 10^{-5}$ — encode a wealth of information:

### The angular power spectrum
The fluctuations are decomposed into spherical harmonics, and the power at each angular scale $\ell$ produces the famous CMB power spectrum with its series of **acoustic peaks**.

- **Odd peaks** (1st, 3rd, ...) correspond to compressions of the baryon-photon fluid falling into dark matter potential wells.
- **Even peaks** (2nd, 4th, ...) correspond to rarefactions.
- The **height ratio** of odd to even peaks directly measures the baryon density $\Omega_b$. See [[Density Parameters]].
- The **position of the first peak** ($\ell \approx 220$) tells us the spatial curvature: its measured location is consistent with a flat universe ($k = 0$).

### What shapes the spectrum
- [[Cold Dark Matter]] provides the gravitational potential wells.
- [[Baryonic Matter]] loads the oscillating fluid, boosting the odd peaks.
- [[Cosmic Inflation]] sets the initial conditions — nearly scale-invariant perturbations. See [[Primordial Perturbations]].
- [[Dark Energy]] affects the CMB indirectly through the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and geometric projection.

## Polarization

The CMB is also polarized, with two modes:
- **E-modes**: generated by the same acoustic oscillations as the temperature fluctuations. Well measured.
- **B-modes**: can be generated by gravitational waves from inflation (primordial B-modes) or by gravitational lensing of E-modes. Primordial B-modes, if detected, would be a "smoking gun" for inflation and constrain the energy scale at which it occurred.

## Key experiments

| Experiment | Era | Key contribution |
|-----------|-----|-----------------|
| COBE (1992) | Discovery | First detection of CMB anisotropies |
| WMAP (2001–2010) | Precision | Measured first three acoustic peaks, pinned down basic ΛCDM parameters |
| Planck (2009–2013) | High precision | Mapped the full power spectrum to $\ell > 2500$, measured 6 ΛCDM parameters to percent-level accuracy |

## What the CMB tells us

From the Planck 2018 results, the CMB alone constrains:
- $H_0 \approx 67.4\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$ — see [[Hubble Constant]]
- $\Omega_b h^2 \approx 0.0224$ — baryon density
- $\Omega_c h^2 \approx 0.120$ — cold dark matter density
- $n_s \approx 0.965$ — spectral index of primordial perturbations
- $\tau \approx 0.054$ — optical depth to reionization

This is the foundation of precision cosmology within ΛCDM.

## Connections

- [[Cosmological Principle]] — the CMB's near-uniformity is the strongest evidence for large-scale isotropy
- [[Cosmic Inflation]] — sets the initial perturbations that become CMB anisotropies
- [[Primordial Perturbations]] — the spectrum of initial fluctuations imprinted in the CMB
- [[Baryonic Matter]] — baryon density measured from acoustic peak ratios
- [[Hubble Tension]] — the CMB-derived $H_0$ disagrees with local measurements
