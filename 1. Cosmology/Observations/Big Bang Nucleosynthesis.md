# Big Bang Nucleosynthesis

Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) is the process by which the lightest atomic nuclei were forged in the first few minutes after the Big Bang. The predicted primordial abundances of hydrogen, helium, and lithium match observations with remarkable precision, making BBN one of the key observational successes of the [[Standard model of cosmology|ΛCDM model]].

## What happened

### Timeline
1. **$t \sim 1$ second, $T \sim 10^{10}$ K**: Neutrinos decouple from the plasma. The neutron-to-proton ratio freezes out at roughly 1:7 (set by the weak interaction rates and the neutron-proton mass difference).
2. **$t \sim 3$ minutes, $T \sim 10^{9}$ K**: The universe cools enough for deuterium nuclei to survive (the "deuterium bottleneck"). Nuclear reactions rapidly build up heavier nuclei.
3. **$t \sim 20$ minutes**: The universe has cooled and diluted too much for further fusion. Nucleosynthesis is over.

### Products
- **Hydrogen (H)**: ~75% by mass — most protons remain unbound
- **Helium-4 ($^4$He)**: ~25% by mass — nearly all neutrons end up in helium
- **Deuterium (D)**: ~$2.5 \times 10^{-5}$ relative to H — a sensitive baryon density probe
- **Helium-3 ($^3$He)**: trace amounts
- **Lithium-7 ($^7$Li)**: ~$5 \times 10^{-10}$ relative to H

No significant amounts of heavier elements are produced — those come later from stellar nucleosynthesis.

## Why it matters for ΛCDM

BBN predictions depend on essentially one free parameter: the **baryon-to-photon ratio** $\eta$, which is directly related to the baryon density $\Omega_b$. See [[Density Parameters]].

- **Deuterium** is the most sensitive probe of $\Omega_b$: it is easily destroyed in stars, so its primordial abundance (measured in high-redshift gas clouds) gives a clean constraint.
- The BBN-derived value of $\Omega_b h^2 \approx 0.022$ agrees beautifully with the completely independent CMB measurement from Planck. See [[Cosmic Microwave Background]].

This concordance between two very different epochs (3 minutes vs 380,000 years) is a powerful consistency check of the standard model.

## The lithium problem

The one persistent tension in BBN: the predicted primordial $^7$Li abundance is about 3 times higher than what is observed in old, metal-poor stars. This "cosmological lithium problem" has resisted easy explanation:
- Stellar depletion of lithium may account for some of the discrepancy
- New physics in the nuclear reaction rates or particle physics sector has been explored
- It remains an open (but not crisis-level) puzzle

## Physics involved

BBN is one of the few settings where nuclear physics, particle physics, and cosmology intersect quantitatively:
- **Nuclear reaction rates** (measured in laboratories) determine the yields
- **The expansion rate** during BBN (from the [[Friedmann Equations]]) sets how much time is available for reactions
- **The number of neutrino species** $N_{\text{eff}}$ affects the expansion rate and hence the helium yield — BBN provided the first evidence that there are exactly 3 light neutrino families

- [[Density Parameters]] — BBN constrains $\Omega_b$
- [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] — independent $\Omega_b$ measurement for cross-check
- [[Radiation and Neutrinos]] — BBN occurs in the radiation-dominated era; $N_{\text{eff}}$ affects yields
- [[Friedmann Equations]] — the expansion rate during BBN determines the outcome
- [[Baryonic Matter]] — BBN is the origin of the primordial baryonic composition
