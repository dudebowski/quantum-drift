# Large-Scale Structure

The large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe — the distribution of galaxies, galaxy clusters, filaments, and voids — is one of the key observational pillars of the [[Standard model of cosmology|ΛCDM model]]. It provides a three-dimensional map of how matter is arranged, complementing the two-dimensional snapshot of the [[Cosmic Microwave Background]].

## The cosmic web

On scales of tens to hundreds of megaparsecs, matter is not uniformly distributed but arranged in a **cosmic web**:
- **Filaments**: elongated structures of galaxies and gas stretching across tens of Mpc
- **Nodes/clusters**: dense concentrations of galaxies at filament intersections
- **Voids**: large, roughly spherical regions with very few galaxies
- **Walls/sheets**: flattened structures connecting filaments

This web-like pattern is a direct prediction of ΛCDM: [[Cold Dark Matter]] clumps under gravity starting from the small perturbations set by [[Cosmic Inflation]], and baryonic matter follows the dark matter scaffolding.

## Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO)

Before recombination, the baryon-photon fluid oscillated in the gravitational potential wells of dark matter (the same oscillations that produce CMB acoustic peaks). When photons decoupled at $z \approx 1100$, baryons were "frozen" in place with a characteristic over-density at a specific radius — the **sound horizon** at recombination, approximately 150 Mpc (comoving).

This imprints a preferred scale in the galaxy distribution: there is a slight excess probability of finding two galaxies separated by ~150 Mpc. The BAO scale acts as a **standard ruler** that can be measured at different redshifts to track the expansion history of the universe.

### What BAO measurements constrain
- The expansion rate $H(z)$ and angular diameter distance $d_A(z)$ at the survey redshift
- Combined with CMB data, tight constraints on $\Omega_m$, $\Omega_\Lambda$, and $H_0$
- The equation of state of [[Dark Energy]]

## Galaxy surveys

Major surveys mapping the large-scale structure:

| Survey | Type | Key contribution |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| SDSS | Spectroscopic galaxy survey | First clear BAO detection (2005) |
| 2dFGRS | Galaxy redshift survey | Confirmed ΛCDM matter power spectrum |
| BOSS/eBOSS | Spectroscopic | Precision BAO over 0.2 < z < 2.2 |
| DESI | Spectroscopic (ongoing) | BAO to sub-percent precision, testing dark energy evolution |
| Euclid | Space-based (ongoing) | Weak lensing + galaxy clustering |

## The matter power spectrum

The statistical summary of LSS is the **matter power spectrum** $P(k)$, measuring how much structure exists at each spatial scale $k$. ΛCDM predicts a specific shape:
- Nearly scale-invariant at large scales (set by [[Primordial Perturbations]])
- A turnover at the scale of matter-radiation equality
- Suppression at small scales from free-streaming of neutrinos and baryon pressure effects

The observed $P(k)$ from galaxy surveys matches ΛCDM predictions across three decades in scale.

- [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] — LSS and CMB probe the same primordial perturbations at different epochs
- [[Cold Dark Matter]] — the gravitational driver of structure formation
- [[Baryonic Matter]] — baryons trace the dark matter web, with BAO as a baryon-specific feature
- [[Dark Energy]] — BAO measurements constrain the expansion history and dark energy properties
- [[Cosmological Principle]] — LSS surveys test large-scale homogeneity
