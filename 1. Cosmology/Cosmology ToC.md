# Cosmology — Table of Contents

This section covers the **standard model of cosmology** (ΛCDM) and its building blocks: the theoretical foundations, the components of the universe, the observations that constrain the model, its key parameters, and the open questions that point beyond it.

## Overview

- [[Standard model of cosmology]] — The ΛCDM model: an expanding universe filled with dark energy, cold dark matter, and ordinary matter

---

## Foundations

The theoretical framework underlying ΛCDM.

- [[Cosmological Principle]] — Homogeneity and isotropy of the universe on large scales
- [[FLRW Metric]] — The Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker spacetime geometry
- [[Friedmann Equations]] — The dynamical equations governing cosmic expansion
- [[Cosmic Inflation]] — Rapid early expansion that set the initial conditions

---

## Components

The ingredients of the universe and their roles in the energy budget.

- [[Dark Energy]] — The cosmological constant Λ driving accelerated expansion (~69%)
- [[Cold Dark Matter]] — Non-baryonic matter driving structure formation (~26%)
- [[Baryonic Matter]] — Ordinary matter: stars, gas, planets, us (~5%)
- [[Radiation and Neutrinos]] — Photons and neutrinos, dominant in the early universe

---

## Observations

The key observational pillars that confirm and constrain ΛCDM.

- [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] — The thermal relic from recombination (z ≈ 1100)
- [[Large-Scale Structure]] — Galaxy distribution, the cosmic web, and baryon acoustic oscillations
- [[Big Bang Nucleosynthesis]] — Primordial abundances of light elements (H, He, Li)
- [[Type Ia Supernovae]] — Standard candles that revealed accelerated expansion

---

## Parameters

The small set of numbers that specify the ΛCDM model.

- [[Hubble Constant]] — The present-day expansion rate $H_0$
- [[Density Parameters]] — The fractional energy densities $\Omega_m$, $\Omega_b$, $\Omega_\Lambda$
- [[Primordial Perturbations]] — Amplitude $A_s$, spectral index $n_s$, and optical depth $\tau$

---

## Open Questions

Where ΛCDM is incomplete or under tension.

- [[Hubble Tension]] — The discrepancy between early- and late-universe measurements of $H_0$
- [[Nature of Dark Energy]] — The cosmological constant problem, quintessence, and alternatives to Λ
- [[Nature of Dark Matter]] — WIMPs, axions, and the search for the dark matter particle
- [[Beyond ΛCDM]] — Extensions, modified gravity, bouncing cosmologies, and future probes
