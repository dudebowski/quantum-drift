# Dark Energy

Dark energy is the dominant component of the universe today, making up roughly **68–70%** of the total energy density. In the [[Standard model of cosmology|ΛCDM model]], it is represented by the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ — a constant, uniform energy density that drives the accelerated expansion of the universe.

## The cosmological constant $\Lambda$

Einstein originally introduced $\Lambda$ into his field equations to allow a static universe. After Hubble's discovery of cosmic expansion, it was dropped — then revived in 1998 when [[Type Ia Supernovae]] observations showed the expansion is *accelerating*.

In the [[Friedmann Equations]], $\Lambda$ appears as an extra term:

$$H^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3}\,\rho - \frac{kc^2}{a^2} + \frac{\Lambda c^2}{3}$$

Because $\Lambda$ is constant while matter and radiation dilute as the universe expands, dark energy inevitably comes to dominate at late times.

### Equation of state

Dark energy (as $\Lambda$) has equation of state parameter $w = -1$:

$$p = -\rho c^2$$

This negative pressure is what drives acceleration: in the second Friedmann equation, $\rho + 3p/c^2 < 0$ when $w < -1/3$, giving $\ddot{a} > 0$.

## Connection to quantum field theory

A leading physical interpretation of $\Lambda$ is as **vacuum energy** — the zero-point energy of all quantum fields. In QFT, even empty space has fluctuating fields with a non-zero ground-state energy.

The problem: naively summing quantum zero-point energies gives a vacuum energy density roughly $10^{120}$ times larger than the observed value of $\Lambda$. This is the **cosmological constant problem** — one of the deepest open puzzles in theoretical physics. See [[Nature of Dark Energy]] for more.

For the QFT perspective, see [[The dark|Dark Matter and Dark Energy]].

## Observational evidence

- **Type Ia supernovae** (1998): distant supernovae are fainter than expected in a decelerating universe, implying acceleration. See [[Type Ia Supernovae]].
- **CMB + BAO**: the angular size of CMB acoustic peaks combined with baryon acoustic oscillation measurements require $\Omega_\Lambda \approx 0.69$. See [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] and [[Large-Scale Structure]].
- **Age of the universe**: without dark energy, the universe would be too young to contain the oldest observed stars.

## The density parameter $\Omega_\Lambda$

In ΛCDM, the dark energy density parameter is:

$$\Omega_\Lambda = \frac{\Lambda c^2}{3H_0^2} \approx 0.69$$

See [[Density Parameters]] for context with the other $\Omega$ values.
