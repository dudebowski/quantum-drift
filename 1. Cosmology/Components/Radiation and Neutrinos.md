# Radiation and Neutrinos

Radiation — photons and relativistic neutrinos — is a small residual component of the universe today, but it dominated the energy budget during the first ~50,000 years. Understanding its role is essential for the early-universe physics that underlies the [[Standard model of cosmology|ΛCDM model]].

## Radiation in the Friedmann equations

Radiation has equation of state $w = 1/3$, so its energy density dilutes as:

$$\rho_r \propto a^{-4}$$

The extra factor of $a^{-1}$ compared to matter ($\rho_m \propto a^{-3}$) comes from the cosmological redshift: as the universe expands, both the number density of photons decreases *and* each photon loses energy as its wavelength stretches. This means radiation dominated early on but became subdominant to matter as the universe grew.

## The radiation-dominated era

During the radiation era ($a \ll a_{\text{eq}}$):
- The scale factor grows as $a(t) \propto t^{1/2}$
- Temperature falls as $T \propto a^{-1}$
- Key events occur in this era: [[Big Bang Nucleosynthesis]] (~3 minutes), neutrino decoupling (~1 second)

The transition to matter domination occurs at the **matter-radiation equality**, around $z_{\text{eq}} \approx 3400$, roughly 50,000 years after the Big Bang.

## The cosmic microwave background

The most important relic of the radiation era is the **cosmic microwave background (CMB)** — the thermal radiation released when the universe cooled enough for atoms to form (recombination, $z \approx 1100$, ~380,000 years). Today it is observed as a near-perfect blackbody at $T \approx 2.725\,\text{K}$. See [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] for details.

## Cosmic neutrino background

Neutrinos decoupled from the rest of the plasma about 1 second after the Big Bang, when the temperature dropped below ~1 MeV. They have been free-streaming ever since, forming the **cosmic neutrino background** (C$\nu$B):
- Predicted temperature today: $T_\nu \approx 1.95\,\text{K}$
- Not yet directly detected (neutrinos interact too weakly), but their gravitational effects are seen in the CMB and large-scale structure.

### Effective number of neutrino species $N_{\text{eff}}$

The contribution of relativistic species to the radiation density is parameterised by $N_{\text{eff}}$:

$$\rho_r = \rho_\gamma \left[1 + \frac{7}{8}\left(\frac{4}{11}\right)^{4/3} N_{\text{eff}}\right]$$

The standard value is $N_{\text{eff}} = 3.044$ (three neutrino families with small corrections). Deviations would signal extra relativistic particles beyond the Standard Model.

## Neutrino masses

Neutrinos have small but non-zero masses (oscillation experiments show $\sum m_\nu > 0.06\,\text{eV}$). Massive neutrinos transition from relativistic to non-relativistic as the universe cools, acting as radiation early and matter late. Their mass affects:
- The CMB power spectrum (suppression of small-scale lensing)
- Structure formation (free-streaming erases small-scale perturbations)

Cosmological observations currently constrain $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.12\,\text{eV}$ (Planck + BAO).
