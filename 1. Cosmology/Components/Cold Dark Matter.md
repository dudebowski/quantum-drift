# Cold Dark Matter

Cold dark matter (CDM) is the second-largest component of the universe in the [[Standard model of cosmology|ΛCDM model]], making up roughly **25–27%** of the total energy density. It is non-relativistic ("cold"), non-baryonic, and interacts with ordinary matter only through gravity — making it invisible to telescopes but detectable through its gravitational effects.

## Role in ΛCDM

Dark matter is the gravitational scaffolding of the universe. Without it, the observed large-scale structure — galaxies, clusters, filaments, and voids — cannot be explained:

- Dark matter clumps first under gravity, forming **halos** that ordinary matter then falls into and lights up as galaxies.
- It provides the extra gravitational pull needed to explain galaxy rotation curves, cluster dynamics, and gravitational lensing.
- In the [[Friedmann Equations]], CDM contributes to $\Omega_m$ as a pressureless dust ($w = 0$), with density scaling as $\rho_{\text{CDM}} \propto a^{-3}$.

## "Cold" vs "hot" dark matter

- **Cold** dark matter particles were non-relativistic when they decoupled from the primordial plasma. This allows structure to form on all scales, bottom-up (small structures first, merging into larger ones).
- **Hot** dark matter (e.g. ordinary neutrinos) was relativistic at decoupling and would wash out small-scale structure — ruled out as the dominant dark matter component by observations of galaxy clustering.

## Evidence for dark matter

- **Galaxy rotation curves**: stars in the outer parts of galaxies orbit faster than expected from visible mass alone.
- **Gravitational lensing**: clusters bend light more than their visible mass can account for.
- **CMB anisotropies**: the detailed pattern of [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] peaks requires a CDM component with $\Omega_{\text{CDM}} \approx 0.25$. See [[Density Parameters]].
- **Large-scale structure**: the distribution of galaxies matches simulations that include CDM but fails without it. See [[Large-Scale Structure]].
- **Bullet Cluster**: a collision between galaxy clusters where the mass (traced by lensing) is separated from the gas (traced by X-rays), demonstrating that most of the mass is non-baryonic.

## Particle candidates

The nature of dark matter particles is unknown. Leading candidates include:

- **WIMPs** (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles): new particles at the ~100 GeV scale, naturally produced in the early universe with roughly the right abundance (the "WIMP miracle").
- **Axions**: very light particles originally proposed to solve a problem in QCD, now considered a strong dark matter candidate.
- **Sterile neutrinos**: hypothetical neutrinos that interact only through gravity.

All of these are fundamentally quantum objects described by quantum fields, just like Standard Model particles. See [[The dark|Dark Matter and Dark Energy]] and [[Nature of Dark Matter]] for more.
