# Baryonic Matter

Baryonic matter — protons, neutrons, electrons, and everything built from them — is the "ordinary" matter that makes up stars, planets, gas, dust, and us. Despite being the most familiar component of the universe, it contributes only about **5%** of the total energy density in the [[Standard model of cosmology|ΛCDM model]].

## Role in ΛCDM

In the [[Friedmann Equations]], baryonic matter behaves as pressureless dust ($w = 0$) at late times, with density scaling as $\rho_b \propto a^{-3}$. It is grouped with [[Cold Dark Matter]] in the total matter density parameter $\Omega_m$, but its own density parameter $\Omega_b \approx 0.05$ is measured independently. See [[Density Parameters]].

Baryons are distinct from dark matter in one crucial way: they interact electromagnetically. This means they:
- Emit and absorb light (enabling all of astronomy)
- Experience radiation pressure (important in the early universe)
- Form atoms, molecules, stars, and planets through electromagnetic and nuclear forces

## Baryonic matter in the early universe

### Before recombination (~380,000 years)
Baryons were tightly coupled to photons through Thomson scattering, forming a single **baryon-photon fluid**. This fluid oscillated under the competing forces of gravity (compression) and radiation pressure (expansion), creating the **baryon acoustic oscillations** (BAOs) imprinted in both the [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] and the [[Large-Scale Structure|large-scale distribution of galaxies]].

### Big Bang nucleosynthesis (~3 minutes)
In the first few minutes, the universe was hot and dense enough for nuclear fusion. This produced the primordial abundances of light elements: about 75% hydrogen, 25% helium-4, and trace amounts of deuterium, helium-3, and lithium-7. The predicted abundances depend sensitively on $\Omega_b$ and match observations well — a major success of the standard model. See [[Big Bang Nucleosynthesis]].

### After recombination
Once the universe cooled enough for neutral atoms to form, baryons decoupled from photons and began falling into the gravitational potential wells established by [[Cold Dark Matter]], eventually forming galaxies and stars.

## Measuring $\Omega_b$

- **CMB acoustic peaks**: the relative heights of the odd and even peaks in the CMB power spectrum are sensitive to the baryon density. Planck measures $\Omega_b h^2 \approx 0.0224$.
- **Big Bang nucleosynthesis**: the deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio is a precision baryon "thermometer", giving consistent $\Omega_b$ values.
- **Baryon acoustic oscillations**: the characteristic BAO scale in galaxy surveys provides an independent cross-check.

## The missing baryon problem

While $\Omega_b$ is well measured, actually *finding* all the baryons has been a challenge. Stars and visible gas in galaxies account for only a fraction. The rest resides in:
- **Warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM)**: diffuse, hot gas in cosmic filaments
- **Circumgalactic medium**: gas halos around galaxies

Recent observations (e.g. fast radio burst dispersion measures) have largely accounted for these "missing" baryons.
