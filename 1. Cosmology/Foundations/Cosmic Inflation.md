# Cosmic Inflation

Cosmic inflation is the hypothesis that the very early universe underwent a brief period of extremely rapid, exponential expansion. In the [[Standard model of cosmology|ΛCDM model]], inflation is assumed rather than derived — it is a key input that explains several otherwise puzzling features of the observed universe.

## The idea

In the first tiny fraction of a second after the Big Bang (roughly $10^{-36}$ to $10^{-32}$ seconds), the scale factor $a(t)$ grew exponentially:

$$a(t) \propto e^{Ht}$$

where $H$ was approximately constant during inflation. This stretched a sub-atomic patch of space to a size vastly larger than the observable universe today.

## What inflation explains

### The horizon problem
Regions of the CMB sky that are causally disconnected (too far apart to have ever exchanged signals) have almost identical temperatures. Inflation solves this: those regions *were* in causal contact before inflation stretched them apart.

### The flatness problem
The observed spatial curvature is extremely close to zero ($\Omega_k \approx 0$). Without inflation, this requires extraordinary fine-tuning of initial conditions. Inflation dynamically drives $\Omega_k \to 0$ regardless of the starting value.

### The monopole problem
Grand unified theories predict heavy magnetic monopoles in the early universe. Inflation dilutes any such relics to undetectable densities.

## Quantum fluctuations as seeds of structure

During inflation, quantum vacuum fluctuations of the inflaton field are stretched to macroscopic scales by the rapid expansion. These become the **primordial density perturbations** — tiny over- and under-densities that later grow under gravity into galaxies, clusters, and the large-scale structure observed today.

- The resulting perturbation spectrum is nearly **scale-invariant** (equal power on all scales), characterised by the spectral index $n_s \approx 0.965$. See [[Primordial Perturbations]].
- These perturbations are imprinted in the [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] as temperature anisotropies of order $10^{-5}$.

This is where quantum field theory on a curved (FLRW) background enters cosmology: the inflaton is quantised on the expanding spacetime, and its vacuum fluctuations are computed using standard QFT techniques.

## The inflaton field

The simplest inflation models postulate a scalar field $\phi$ (the "inflaton") slowly rolling down a potential $V(\phi)$:
- While $\phi$ rolls slowly, $V(\phi)$ acts like a cosmological constant, driving exponential expansion.
- When $\phi$ reaches the minimum of $V$, inflation ends and the inflaton's energy is converted into ordinary particles ("reheating"), starting the hot Big Bang.

The exact form of $V(\phi)$ is unknown — this is one of the major open questions in cosmology.

## Open questions

- Inflation is **assumed** in ΛCDM, not derived from first principles. What is the inflaton? Is it a fundamental field or an effective description?
- The detailed mechanism and energy scale of inflation are not pinned down by current data.
- Alternative scenarios (e.g. bouncing cosmologies from loop quantum gravity) aim to achieve the same explanatory successes without inflation. See [[Beyond ΛCDM]].
