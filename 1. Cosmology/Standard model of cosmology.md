# The Standard Model of Cosmology

The standard model of cosmology is the ΛCDM (Lambda–Cold Dark Matter) model, which describes an expanding universe filled mostly with dark energy (Λ) and cold dark matter, plus a small amount of ordinary matter and radiation. It is essentially the Big Bang framework, specified by general relativity and a small set of parameters, tuned to match observations like the cosmic microwave background and large‑scale structure.

## Core assumptions

- The universe is **homogeneous** and isotropic on large scales (the cosmological principle).

- General relativity is the correct theory of gravity on cosmological scales.

- Spacetime is well described by a Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) metric, with dynamics given by the Friedmann equations.

- The universe began in a hot, dense state (Big Bang), followed by early cosmic inflation that stretched quantum fluctuations to macroscopic scales.

## Main ingredients

- Dark energy (Λ): a cosmological constant causing the current accelerated expansion; it contributes roughly 68–70% of the total energy density.

- Cold dark matter: non‑relativistic, non‑baryonic matter that clusters and drives structure formation; about 25–27% of the energy density.

- Ordinary (baryonic) matter: protons, neutrons, electrons, planets, stars, gas; about 5%.

- Radiation and neutrinos: a small residual component important mainly in the early universe.

## Key observational successes

ΛCDM with only six or so free parameters fits a wide range of data simultaneously.

- Cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies and polarization.

- Large‑scale distribution of galaxies and clusters, including baryon acoustic oscillations.

- Primordial abundances of light elements from Big Bang nucleosynthesis (H, He, Li).

- Late‑time accelerated expansion inferred from Type Ia supernovae and other distance probes.

## Parameterization

In practice, the model is specified by a small set of cosmological parameters, typically including:

- Hubble constant $H_0$ (current expansion rate).

- Matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ (baryons + dark matter).

- Baryon density $\Omega_b$.

- Dark energy density $\Omega_\Lambda$.

- Amplitude and spectral index of primordial scalar perturbations (e.g., $A_s$, $n_s$).

- Sometimes optical depth to reionization, $\tau$.

## Open issues and tensions

Despite its success, ΛCDM is incomplete.

- The fundamental nature of dark matter and dark energy is unknown.

- The model assumes, rather than derives, inflation and its detailed mechanism.

- Parameter "tensions" exist, notably different values of $H_0$ from early‑ and late‑universe measurements (the Hubble tension), which may hint at new physics beyond ΛCDM.
