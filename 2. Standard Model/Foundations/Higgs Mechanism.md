# The Higgs Mechanism

The Higgs mechanism is the process by which particles in the [[Standard model of particle physics|Standard Model]] acquire mass. It breaks the electroweak symmetry $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ down to the electromagnetic $U(1)_{\text{EM}}$, giving masses to the W and Z bosons and to the fermions while keeping the photon massless.

## The problem it solves

The [[Gauge Symmetry]] of the Standard Model forbids explicit mass terms for gauge bosons and (left-handed) fermions in [[The Lagrangian]]. A mass term for a gauge boson like $m^2 W_\mu W^\mu$ would break gauge invariance and ruin the theory's mathematical consistency (renormalizability).

Yet the W and Z bosons *are* massive ($m_W \approx 80.4$ GeV, $m_Z \approx 91.2$ GeV). The Higgs mechanism provides mass *without* explicitly breaking the gauge symmetry — the symmetry is broken **spontaneously**.

## Spontaneous symmetry breaking

The Higgs field is a complex $SU(2)$ doublet with four real degrees of freedom:

$$\Phi = \begin{pmatrix} \phi^+ \\ \phi^0 \end{pmatrix}$$

Its potential is:

$$V(\Phi) = -\mu^2 \Phi^\dagger \Phi + \lambda (\Phi^\dagger \Phi)^2$$

with $\mu^2 > 0$ and $\lambda > 0$. This "Mexican hat" potential has its minimum not at $\Phi = 0$ but on a circle of nonzero field values. The Higgs field settles into a particular minimum — the **vacuum expectation value** (VEV):

$$\langle \Phi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ v \end{pmatrix}, \qquad v \approx 246\,\text{GeV}$$

The underlying equations still have the full $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ symmetry, but the vacuum state does not — this is spontaneous symmetry breaking.

## What the Higgs mechanism gives

### Gauge boson masses
The nonzero VEV causes three of the four electroweak gauge bosons to acquire mass:
- $W^\pm$ bosons: $m_W = \frac{1}{2} g v \approx 80.4$ GeV
- $Z^0$ boson: $m_Z = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{g^2 + g'^2}\, v \approx 91.2$ GeV
- Photon $\gamma$: remains massless (the $U(1)_{\text{EM}}$ symmetry is preserved)

Three of the four Higgs degrees of freedom are "eaten" by the $W^\pm$ and $Z$, becoming their longitudinal polarisation modes. The fourth degree of freedom remains as a physical scalar particle: the [[Higgs Boson]].

### Fermion masses
Fermions acquire mass through **Yukawa couplings** — interactions between the Higgs field and the fermion fields. After the Higgs gets its VEV:

$$m_f = \frac{y_f \, v}{\sqrt{2}}$$

where $y_f$ is the Yukawa coupling constant for fermion $f$. The enormous range of fermion masses (from sub-eV neutrinos to the 173 GeV top quark) reflects the enormous range of Yukawa couplings. See [[Fermion Masses]].

## Electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB)

Before EWSB ($T \gg 10^{15}$ K, roughly $10^{-12}$ seconds after the Big Bang):
- The full $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ symmetry is unbroken
- All electroweak gauge bosons are massless
- The weak and electromagnetic forces are unified into a single electroweak interaction

After EWSB:
- $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y \to U(1)_{\text{EM}}$
- $W^\pm$ and $Z^0$ become massive, photon stays massless
- The weak force becomes short-range (mediated by heavy bosons), while electromagnetism remains long-range

## Connection to the Goldstone theorem

Goldstone's theorem says spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry produces massless scalar particles (Goldstone bosons). In the Higgs mechanism, these would-be Goldstone bosons are "eaten" by the gauge bosons, giving them mass instead. This is sometimes called the "Higgs mechanism eats the Goldstone bosons."
