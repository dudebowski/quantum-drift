# The Standard Model Lagrangian

The Lagrangian is the single mathematical expression from which all of the Standard Model's physics is derived. It encodes every particle, every interaction, every conservation law, and every prediction. The entire [[Standard model of particle physics|Standard Model]] is defined by specifying the fields, the [[Gauge Symmetry]], and this Lagrangian.

## Structure

The Standard Model Lagrangian has four main pieces:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{gauge}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{fermion}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{Higgs}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{Yukawa}}$$

### Gauge kinetic terms: $\mathcal{L}_{\text{gauge}}$

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{gauge}} = -\frac{1}{4}G^a_{\mu\nu}G^{a\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{4}W^i_{\mu\nu}W^{i\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{4}B_{\mu\nu}B^{\mu\nu}$$

These describe how the gauge bosons propagate and self-interact:
- $G^a_{\mu\nu}$: gluon field strengths ($a = 1,...,8$) — see [[Strong Force]]
- $W^i_{\mu\nu}$: weak isospin field strengths ($i = 1,2,3$) — see [[Weak Force]]
- $B_{\mu\nu}$: hypercharge field strength — see [[Electromagnetic Force]]

The non-abelian structure of $SU(3)$ and $SU(2)$ means the field strengths contain self-interaction terms: gluons interact with gluons, and $W$ bosons interact with each other.

### Fermion kinetic terms: $\mathcal{L}_{\text{fermion}}$

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{fermion}} = \sum_f \bar{\psi}_f \, i \gamma^\mu D_\mu \, \psi_f$$

Each fermion field $\psi_f$ ([[Quarks]] and [[Leptons]]) has a kinetic term involving the **covariant derivative** $D_\mu$. The covariant derivative contains the gauge fields, so this single term encodes:
- How fermions propagate
- All interactions between fermions and gauge bosons

The specific charges of each fermion under $SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ determine which gauge bosons it couples to and how strongly.

### Higgs sector: $\mathcal{L}_{\text{Higgs}}$

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{Higgs}} = (D_\mu \Phi)^\dagger (D^\mu \Phi) - V(\Phi)$$

where $V(\Phi) = -\mu^2 \Phi^\dagger \Phi + \lambda (\Phi^\dagger \Phi)^2$ is the Higgs potential. This term:
- Gives the Higgs field its dynamics
- Contains the "Mexican hat" potential that drives [[Higgs Mechanism|electroweak symmetry breaking]]
- Through the covariant derivative, generates the W and Z boson masses after the Higgs acquires its VEV

### Yukawa terms: $\mathcal{L}_{\text{Yukawa}}$

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{Yukawa}} = -y_u \bar{Q}_L \tilde{\Phi} u_R - y_d \bar{Q}_L \Phi d_R - y_e \bar{L}_L \Phi e_R + \text{h.c.}$$

These couple the Higgs field to the fermion fields. After the Higgs acquires its VEV, the Yukawa couplings $y_f$ become [[Fermion Masses]]:

$$m_f = \frac{y_f \, v}{\sqrt{2}}$$

The Yukawa couplings are **not** determined by the gauge symmetry — they are free parameters. With three generations, the Yukawa matrices also give rise to [[Flavor Mixing]] (CKM and PMNS matrices).

## What the Lagrangian determines

From $\mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}}$, using the machinery of [[Quantum Field Theory]], one can calculate:
- **Feynman rules**: which particles interact, with what vertex factors
- **Cross sections**: probability of scattering processes at colliders
- **Decay rates**: lifetimes and branching ratios of unstable particles
- **Running couplings**: how [[Gauge Couplings]] change with energy
- **Anomalous magnetic moments**: precision QED predictions like $g-2$

## Counting parameters

The Standard Model Lagrangian contains about **19 free parameters** (or ~25–28 including neutrino masses):
- 3 [[Gauge Couplings]] ($g_s$, $g$, $g'$)
- 2 [[Higgs Parameters]] ($\mu$, $\lambda$ or equivalently $v$, $m_H$)
- 6 quark masses, 3 charged lepton masses — see [[Fermion Masses]]
- 4 CKM parameters (3 angles + 1 CP phase) — see [[Flavor Mixing]]
- 1 strong CP angle $\bar{\theta}$

None of these are predicted by the theory — they must all be measured. Understanding *why* these values are what they are is one of the deepest [[Hierarchy Problem|open questions]].
