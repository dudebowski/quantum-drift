# The Strong Force (QCD)

The strong force is the most powerful of the three forces in the [[Standard model of particle physics|Standard Model]]. It binds [[Quarks]] into protons, neutrons, and other hadrons, and holds atomic nuclei together. Its quantum field theory is called **Quantum Chromodynamics** (QCD), based on the $SU(3)_C$ sector of the [[Gauge Symmetry]].

## Basics

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Gauge group | $SU(3)_C$ |
| Charge | Color (red, green, blue) |
| Mediators | 8 gluons |
| Coupling constant | $\alpha_s \approx 0.118$ at $m_Z$ |
| Range | ~$10^{-15}$ m (1 fm) |
| Acts on | [[Quarks]] and gluons (color-charged particles) |

## Color charge

The strong force acts on **color charge**, which comes in three types: red ($r$), green ($g$), and blue ($b$). Anti-quarks carry anti-colors ($\bar{r}$, $\bar{g}$, $\bar{b}$). Gluons carry one color and one anti-color.

The requirement that observable particles be **color-neutral** ("white") explains why quarks are only found in:
- **Baryons** ($qqq$): one quark of each color → $r + g + b =$ white
- **Mesons** ($q\bar{q}$): a color-anticolor pair → e.g. $r + \bar{r} =$ white

More exotic color-neutral combinations (tetraquarks, pentaquarks) have also been observed at the LHC.

## Confinement

At low energies and large distances, the strong coupling $\alpha_s$ grows. The gluon field between separating quarks does not spread out (as the photon field does) but forms a narrow **flux tube** or "string" whose energy grows with distance. Attempting to pull quarks apart eventually provides enough energy to create a new quark-antiquark pair from the vacuum — the result is always hadrons, never free quarks.

This property, called **confinement**, is believed to be a consequence of QCD but has never been rigorously proven from first principles. (It is one of the Millennium Prize Problems in mathematics.)

## Asymptotic freedom

At high energies and short distances, the strong coupling $\alpha_s$ **decreases** — quarks behave as if nearly free. This is **asymptotic freedom**, discovered by Gross, Politzer, and Wilczek (2004 Nobel Prize).

Asymptotic freedom means:
- Perturbation theory works at high energies (jet physics, deep inelastic scattering)
- The coupling "runs" significantly with energy. See [[Gauge Couplings]].
- At low energies, perturbation theory breaks down and one must use non-perturbative methods (lattice QCD)

## Experimental validation

The overview article lists QCD validation as a key success of the Standard Model:

- **Deep inelastic scattering**: The scaling violations observed at SLAC and later at HERA confirmed the running of $\alpha_s$ and the quark-gluon structure of the proton.
- **Jet production**: High-energy collisions produce collimated sprays of hadrons ("jets"), whose rates and angular distributions match QCD predictions.
- **Hadron spectroscopy**: The spectrum of mesons and baryons, calculated using lattice QCD, agrees with observations.
- **$\alpha_s$ measurements**: The strong coupling has been measured in many different processes (jet rates, lattice, $\tau$ decays, event shapes), all giving consistent values when evolved to a common scale.

## The residual strong force

The strong force between quarks inside a nucleon is not the same as the force between nucleons in a nucleus. The nuclear force that binds protons and neutrons is a **residual** effect of QCD — analogous to how van der Waals forces between neutral atoms are a residual effect of electromagnetism. This residual force is often modeled by meson exchange (Yukawa's original idea) and is responsible for all of nuclear physics.
