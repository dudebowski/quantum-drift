# The Electromagnetic Force (QED)

The electromagnetic force is the best-understood force in the [[Standard model of particle physics|Standard Model]] and the most precisely tested quantum field theory in existence. It governs the interactions of electrically charged particles and is responsible for chemistry, light, electronics, and essentially all everyday phenomena. Its quantum theory is called **Quantum Electrodynamics** (QED).

## Basics

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Gauge group | $U(1)_{\text{EM}}$ (after EWSB) |
| Charge | Electric charge $Q$ |
| Mediator | Photon ($\gamma$) |
| Coupling constant | $\alpha_{\text{EM}} \approx 1/137$ at low energies |
| Range | Infinite (photon is massless) |
| Acts on | All electrically charged particles |

## Where it sits in the Standard Model

Electromagnetism is not a "standalone" force in the Standard Model — it emerges from **electroweak symmetry breaking**. Before the [[Higgs Mechanism]] breaks $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$:
- There is no separate electromagnetic force
- The $W^3$ and $B$ bosons are distinct but mixed

After symmetry breaking:
- The photon $\gamma = \sin\theta_W \, W^3 + \cos\theta_W \, B$ emerges as the massless gauge boson of the unbroken $U(1)_{\text{EM}}$
- Electric charge is related to weak isospin and hypercharge: $Q = T_3 + Y/2$

So QED is the **low-energy limit** of the electroweak theory. See [[Gauge Symmetry]] and [[Weak Force]].

## Precision QED

QED is the most precisely verified theory in physics. The overview article highlights QED precision as a key observational success.

### The electron anomalous magnetic moment

The Dirac equation predicts $g = 2$ for the electron's magnetic moment. QED loop corrections modify this:

$$a_e = \frac{g-2}{2} = \frac{\alpha}{2\pi} + \text{higher-order terms}$$

The current theoretical value involves Feynman diagrams up to 5th order (>12,000 diagrams). Theory and experiment agree to better than **1 part in $10^{10}$**:

$$a_e^{\text{exp}} = 0.001\,159\,652\,180\,73(28)$$

This is arguably the most precise prediction-vs-measurement agreement in all of science.

### The muon $g-2$

The muon anomalous magnetic moment $a_\mu$ is more sensitive to heavy virtual particles because $m_\mu \gg m_e$. A persistent ~4–5σ discrepancy between the measured $a_\mu$ and some SM calculations has attracted enormous attention, though lattice QCD results have recently brought the theoretical prediction closer to the experimental value. The situation remains under active investigation.

## Key features of QED

### Perturbation theory
Because $\alpha \approx 1/137$ is small, QED calculations converge rapidly as a series in powers of $\alpha$. Each order adds more Feynman diagrams (loops) but contributes a smaller correction.

### Running coupling
The electromagnetic coupling **increases** at higher energies (shorter distances) due to vacuum polarization — virtual electron-positron pairs screen the bare charge. At the $Z$ mass scale:

$$\alpha_{\text{EM}}(m_Z) \approx 1/128$$

See [[Gauge Couplings]] for more on running couplings.

### QED is abelian
Unlike QCD ($SU(3)$) and the weak force ($SU(2)$), $U(1)_{\text{EM}}$ is **abelian** — the photon does not carry electric charge and does not self-interact. This makes QED technically simpler than the non-abelian gauge theories.

## Everyday consequences

Virtually all phenomena at human scales are electromagnetic:
- Atomic structure and chemistry (electron-nucleus binding)
- Light and optics (photon emission and absorption)
- Solid-state physics, electronics, magnetism
- Molecular biology (chemical bonds)

Gravity shapes the large-scale universe; the strong force holds nuclei together; the weak force drives certain decays. But the electromagnetic force governs nearly everything in between.
