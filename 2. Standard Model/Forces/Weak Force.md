# The Weak Force

The weak force is responsible for processes that change the flavor of particles — most famously beta decay, in which a neutron transforms into a proton. It is the only force that acts on **all** fermions (including neutrinos), the only force that violates **parity** (mirror symmetry), and the only force mediated by **massive** gauge bosons. In the [[Standard model of particle physics|Standard Model]], it is unified with electromagnetism into the electroweak interaction.

## Basics

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Gauge group | $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ (before EWSB) |
| Charge | Weak isospin $T_3$ |
| Mediators | $W^\pm$ (80.4 GeV), $Z^0$ (91.2 GeV) |
| Coupling constant | $\alpha_W \approx 1/30$ |
| Range | ~$10^{-18}$ m |
| Acts on | All fermions (left-handed doublets) |

## Charged currents ($W^\pm$)

The $W^\pm$ bosons mediate **flavor-changing** interactions:

### Quark sector
- $d \to u + W^- \to u + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$ (beta decay)
- $s \to u + W^-$ (kaon decay)
- Cross-generation transitions ($b \to c$, $t \to b$, etc.) are all mediated by $W^\pm$

The probability of each quark flavor transition is governed by the **CKM matrix**. See [[Flavor Mixing]].

### Lepton sector
- $\mu^- \to e^- + \bar{\nu}_e + \nu_\mu$ (muon decay)
- $\tau^- \to e^- + \bar{\nu}_e + \nu_\tau$ (tau decay)
- Neutrino interactions: $\nu_e + n \to p + e^-$

With neutrino masses, lepton flavor mixing is described by the **PMNS matrix**. See [[Flavor Mixing]].

## Neutral currents ($Z^0$)

The $Z^0$ mediates interactions that do not change flavor (at tree level):
- $\nu_\mu + e^- \to \nu_\mu + e^-$ (neutrino scattering)
- $e^+ e^- \to f\bar{f}$ at the $Z$ pole (LEP/SLC precision measurements)

Neutral currents were predicted by the electroweak theory and first observed at CERN in 1973 — a crucial confirmation before the $W$ and $Z$ were directly discovered in 1983. See [[Gauge Bosons]].

## Parity violation

The weak force has a unique property: it **violates parity** (left-right symmetry). The $SU(2)_L$ gauge group acts only on **left-handed** fermions and **right-handed** antifermions. This means:

- Only left-handed neutrinos and right-handed antineutrinos interact weakly
- The $W$ boson couples exclusively to left-handed fermion doublets
- The $Z$ boson couples to both left- and right-handed fermions, but with different strengths

This was experimentally confirmed in the Wu experiment (1957) on beta decay of cobalt-60.

## CP violation

The weak force also violates **CP symmetry** (the combined operation of charge conjugation and parity). CP violation in the quark sector arises from a complex phase in the CKM matrix and has been observed in:
- Kaon decays (1964, Cronin and Fitch, Nobel Prize 1980)
- $B$-meson decays (Belle, BaBar)
- $D$-meson decays (LHCb)

CP violation is a necessary ingredient for explaining the [[Baryon Asymmetry|matter-antimatter asymmetry]] of the universe, though the amount of CP violation in the Standard Model appears insufficient.

## Electroweak unification

Above the electroweak scale (~246 GeV), the weak and electromagnetic forces are unified into a single **electroweak** interaction based on $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$. The [[Higgs Mechanism]] breaks this symmetry at lower energies, producing:
- Massive $W^\pm$ and $Z^0$ (short-range weak force)
- Massless photon (long-range electromagnetism)

The unification was formulated by Glashow, Weinberg, and Salam (Nobel Prize 1979) and confirmed by the discovery of the $W$ and $Z$ at CERN.

## Precision electroweak measurements

The overview article highlights precision electroweak tests as a key success of the Standard Model. Measurements at LEP, SLC, and the Tevatron include:
- $Z$-pole observables (mass, width, asymmetries) — agree with SM at per-mille level
- $W$ mass — a precision benchmark (recent CDF measurement has generated tension)
- Number of light neutrino species: $N_\nu = 2.984 \pm 0.008$ from the $Z$ width (confirming exactly 3 light flavors)
