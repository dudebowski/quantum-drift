# Standard Model of Particle Physics — Table of Contents

This section covers the **Standard Model of particle physics** — the quantum field theory based on $SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ that describes all known elementary particles and three of the four fundamental forces: the strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions.

## Foundations

The theoretical framework underlying the Standard Model.

- [[Gauge Symmetry]] — Local gauge invariance under $SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$
- [[Quantum Field Theory]] — Particles as excitations of quantum fields; the language of the SM
- [[Higgs Mechanism]] — Electroweak symmetry breaking and mass generation
- [[The Lagrangian]] — The single expression encoding all SM physics: kinetic, gauge, Yukawa, and Higgs terms

## Particles

The elementary particle content of the Standard Model.

- [[Quarks]] — Six flavors in three generations, carrying color charge
- [[Leptons]] — Charged leptons and neutrinos in three generations
- [[Gauge Bosons]] — Gluons, photon, $W^\pm$, and $Z^0$: the force carriers
- [[Higgs Boson]] — The scalar boson discovered in 2012, confirming the Higgs mechanism

---

## Forces

The three fundamental interactions described by the Standard Model.

- [[Strong Force]] — QCD: color confinement, asymptotic freedom, and nuclear binding
- [[Electromagnetic Force]] — QED: the most precisely tested theory in physics
- [[Weak Force]] — Flavor-changing interactions, parity violation, and electroweak unification

## Parameters

The free parameters that the Standard Model does not predict.

- [[Gauge Couplings]] — $\alpha_s$, $\alpha_{\text{EM}}$, $\alpha_W$, and their running with energy
- [[Higgs Parameters]] — Mass (~125 GeV), vacuum expectation value (~246 GeV), and self-coupling
- [[Fermion Masses]] — Yukawa couplings and the mass hierarchy from sub-eV to 173 GeV
- [[Flavor Mixing]] — The CKM matrix (quarks) and PMNS matrix (leptons), including CP violation
