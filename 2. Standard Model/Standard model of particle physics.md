# The Standard Model of Particle Physics

## Core assumptions

- Local gauge symmetry $SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$: Strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces are encoded as gauge interactions of these three symmetry groups, fixing much of the interaction structure.

- Quantum relativistic field theory: Every particle is an excitation of a quantum field, and special relativity plus quantum mechanics strongly constrain allowed dynamics.

- Gravitational effects are so tiny that they can be ignored, so general relativity is not part of the model.

- Higgs mechanism for EWSB: The Higgs field takes on a nonzero vacuum value, breaking $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ down to $U(1)_{\text{EM}}$ and giving masses to W, Z, and fermions while keeping the photon massless.

- No extra light fields: The framework assumes no additional light particles or forces beyond this field content in the energy range tested so far.

## Main ingredients

- Fermion content: Three copies of quark–lepton families, differing only by mass and mixing, encode all known matter (up/down, charm/strange, top/bottom plus electron, muon, tau, and their neutrinos).

- Gauge bosons: Gluons mediate color interactions between quarks; the photon carries electromagnetic interactions; W and Z implement the weak interaction, responsible for processes like beta decay.

- Higgs sector: A single complex Higgs doublet suffices to break electroweak symmetry and generate all fermion and gauge-boson masses in the minimal model.

- Lagrangian structure: The theory is built from kinetic terms (how fields propagate), gauge interaction terms (fixed by symmetry), Yukawa terms (controlling fermion masses and mixings), and the Higgs potential (controlling symmetry breaking).

## Key observational successes

- Precision electroweak: Measurements of Z-pole observables, W and Z masses, and asymmetries match SM predictions at the per‑mille level, strongly constraining alternatives.

- QED precision: Quantities like the electron and muon $g-2$ largely agree with SM loop calculations, demonstrating the accuracy of perturbative quantum field theory.

- QCD validation: Scaling violations in deep inelastic scattering, jet rates, and hadron spectra confirm asymptotic freedom and confinement as described by QCD.

- Predicted particles: The successful prediction and later discovery of W, Z, and a 125 GeV Higgs with approximately SM-like couplings is a central triumph.

- Global collider fit: Across many processes and energies, from fixed-target experiments to the LHC, one coherent parameter set fits essentially all observed cross sections and decay rates.

## Parameterization

- Gauge couplings: Three dimensionless numbers control the strengths of strong, weak, and hypercharge interactions and evolve with energy via renormalization-group running.

- Higgs parameters: The Higgs mass and vacuum expectation value (about 246 GeV) encapsulate the shape of the Higgs potential in the minimal model.

- Fermion masses: Yukawa couplings for each quark and charged lepton translate into their observed mass spectrum after symmetry breaking, spanning many orders of magnitude.

- Flavor mixing: CKM parameters encode quark flavor-changing processes and CP violation; with massive neutrinos, PMNS parameters play a similar role for leptons.

- Extra phases and angles: Including neutrino masses and the strong CP angle yields on the order of a few dozen dimensionless inputs the SM itself does not explain.

## Open issues and tensions

- Missing quantum gravity: No mechanism unifies the SM with general relativity, leaving Planck-scale physics and singularities conceptually unresolved.

- Dark components: The model lacks a robust dark matter candidate and gives no natural explanation for the tiny but nonzero observed dark energy density.

- Baryon asymmetry: Known SM CP violation and electroweak dynamics seem insufficient to generate the observed dominance of matter over antimatter.

- Neutrino masses: Neutrino oscillations require extending the SM (e.g., by right-handed neutrinos or higher-dimensional operators) to give neutrinos mass.

- Naturalness puzzles: The Higgs mass appears unstable to high-energy corrections (hierarchy problem), the strong CP angle seems fine‑tuned, and the pattern of fermion masses and mixings cries out for deeper structure.
