# Fermion Masses

The fermion masses span an enormous range — from sub-eV neutrinos to the 173 GeV top quark — and are among the most puzzling free parameters of the [[Standard model of particle physics|Standard Model]]. Each mass arises from a **Yukawa coupling** to the Higgs field, but the Standard Model offers no explanation for why these couplings take the values they do.

## How fermions get mass

In the Standard Model, [[Gauge Symmetry]] forbids explicit fermion mass terms in [[The Lagrangian]] (because left- and right-handed fermions transform differently under $SU(2)_L$). Instead, masses arise through the [[Higgs Mechanism]]:

1. A Yukawa coupling connects a left-handed fermion doublet, the Higgs field, and a right-handed fermion singlet.
2. When the Higgs acquires its VEV ($v \approx 246$ GeV), each Yukawa term generates a mass:

$$m_f = \frac{y_f \, v}{\sqrt{2}}$$

where $y_f$ is the dimensionless Yukawa coupling for fermion $f$.

## The mass spectrum

### Quarks

| Quark | Mass | Yukawa $y_q$ |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Up ($u$) | ~2.2 MeV | $1.3 \times 10^{-5}$ |
| Down ($d$) | ~4.7 MeV | $2.7 \times 10^{-5}$ |
| Strange ($s$) | ~96 MeV | $5.5 \times 10^{-4}$ |
| Charm ($c$) | ~1.27 GeV | $7.3 \times 10^{-3}$ |
| Bottom ($b$) | ~4.18 GeV | $2.4 \times 10^{-2}$ |
| Top ($t$) | ~173 GeV | $\sim 1$ |

### Charged leptons

| Lepton | Mass | Yukawa $y_\ell$ |
|--------|------|----------------|
| Electron ($e$) | 0.511 MeV | $2.9 \times 10^{-6}$ |
| Muon ($\mu$) | 105.7 MeV | $6.1 \times 10^{-4}$ |
| Tau ($\tau$) | 1776.9 MeV | $1.0 \times 10^{-2}$ |

### Neutrinos

Neutrino masses are not part of the original Standard Model. Oscillation experiments show $\Delta m^2$ values implying masses in the range ~0.01–0.1 eV, with $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.12$ eV from cosmology. See [[Neutrino Masses]].

## The mass hierarchy puzzle

The Yukawa couplings span **six orders of magnitude** (from $y_e \sim 10^{-6}$ to $y_t \sim 1$), and including neutrinos the range extends to ~12 orders of magnitude. The Standard Model treats each Yukawa as an independent free parameter — there is no mechanism that relates or predicts them.

Key questions:
- **Why three generations?** Why not two, or four? The number of generations is not explained.
- **Why this pattern?** Each generation is heavier than the last, but the ratios are irregular. Is there an underlying structure?
- **Why is the top so heavy?** The top quark is the only fermion with a Yukawa coupling of order 1 — is this significant, or coincidental?
- **Why are neutrinos so light?** The neutrino masses are at least 6 orders of magnitude smaller than the electron mass. This may point to a different mass-generation mechanism (e.g. the seesaw mechanism). See [[Neutrino Masses]].

These questions are part of the broader [[Hierarchy Problem]] and motivate extensions of the Standard Model.

## Quark masses and QCD

For light quarks ($u$, $d$, $s$), the "mass" is complicated by [[Strong Force|QCD]] effects:
- Quarks are confined inside hadrons, so their masses cannot be measured directly
- **Current quark masses** (the Lagrangian parameters) are defined at a renormalization scale and run with energy
- **Constituent quark masses** (~300 MeV for $u$, $d$) include the QCD binding energy and are what naive hadron spectroscopy yields
- The proton mass (~938 MeV) is overwhelmingly from QCD binding energy, not from the quark Yukawa couplings ($m_u + m_u + m_d \approx 9$ MeV)
