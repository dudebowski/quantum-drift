# Gauge Couplings

The three gauge couplings are dimensionless numbers that set the strengths of the three forces in the [[Standard model of particle physics|Standard Model]]. They are among the most fundamental parameters of the theory and — remarkably — they are not constant but **run** with energy.

## The three couplings

| Coupling | Force | Symbol | Value at $m_Z$ (~91 GeV) |
|----------|-------|--------|--------------------------|
| Strong | [[Strong Force]] (QCD) | $g_s$ or $\alpha_s = g_s^2/(4\pi)$ | $\alpha_s \approx 0.118$ |
| Weak | [[Weak Force]] ($SU(2)_L$) | $g$ or $\alpha_W = g^2/(4\pi)$ | $\alpha_W \approx 1/30$ |
| Hypercharge | $U(1)_Y$ | $g'$ or $\alpha_Y = g'^2/(4\pi)$ | $\alpha_Y \approx 1/98$ |

After electroweak symmetry breaking, the electromagnetic coupling is:

$$\alpha_{\text{EM}} = \frac{e^2}{4\pi} = \frac{g^2 g'^2}{4\pi(g^2 + g'^2)} \approx \frac{1}{137}$$

at low energies. The weak mixing angle relates them: $\sin^2\theta_W = g'^2/(g^2 + g'^2) \approx 0.231$.

## Renormalization group running

In [[Quantum Field Theory]], virtual particles constantly pop in and out of the vacuum and modify the effective strength of an interaction. This means the coupling constants depend on the **energy scale** $\mu$ at which they are probed. The evolution is governed by the **renormalization group equations** (RGEs):

$$\mu \frac{d\alpha_i}{d\mu} = \beta_i(\alpha_i)$$

where $\beta_i$ is the beta function for coupling $i$.

### How each coupling runs

- **$\alpha_s$ (strong)**: **decreases** at higher energies — this is **asymptotic freedom**. At low energies $\alpha_s$ is large (confinement), at high energies quarks are nearly free. See [[Strong Force]].
- **$\alpha_{\text{EM}}$ (electromagnetic)**: **increases** at higher energies — vacuum polarization (virtual $e^+e^-$ pairs) screens the charge less at shorter distances. $\alpha_{\text{EM}}$ goes from $1/137$ at zero momentum to $\sim 1/128$ at the $Z$ mass.
- **$\alpha_W$ (weak)**: **decreases** at higher energies (non-abelian, like QCD, though less dramatically).

### Grand unification?

A striking observation: when the three couplings are evolved to very high energies, they **nearly converge** at around $10^{15}$–$10^{16}$ GeV. In the minimal Standard Model they do not quite meet at a single point, but in supersymmetric extensions (MSSM) they do — this is taken as a hint of **grand unification** (GUT), where $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ would merge into a single gauge group at high energies.

## Measuring the couplings

### $\alpha_s$
Measured from many processes, all consistent when evolved to $m_Z$:
- Jet production rates at colliders
- Deep inelastic scattering (scaling violations)
- Lattice QCD calculations
- $\tau$ lepton hadronic decay rate
- Event shapes at LEP

### $\alpha_{\text{EM}}$
- Most precisely determined from the electron anomalous magnetic moment $g-2$. See [[Electromagnetic Force]].
- Also measured from the quantum Hall effect and atomic physics

### Weak coupling / $\sin^2\theta_W$
- $Z$-pole measurements at LEP/SLC (asymmetries, partial widths)
- Neutrino scattering cross sections
- Atomic parity violation experiments

## Why they matter

The gauge couplings determine:
- The strength of every interaction vertex in [[The Lagrangian]]
- Cross sections and decay rates for all Standard Model processes
- The masses of the $W$ and $Z$ bosons (through $m_W = gv/2$)
- Whether the couplings unify (clue to physics beyond the SM)

The Standard Model does not explain *why* the couplings have their particular values — this is one of the ~19 free parameters. See [[Hierarchy Problem]] for the broader question of unexplained parameters.
