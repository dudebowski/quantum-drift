# The Dark Sector

The [[Standard model of particle physics|Standard Model]] has no viable **dark matter** candidate and provides no natural explanation for the observed **dark energy** density. Since dark matter and dark energy together make up ~95% of the universe's energy budget (see [[Standard model of cosmology|ΛCDM]]), this is one of the clearest signs that the Standard Model is incomplete.

## Dark matter: no SM candidate

Observational evidence for dark matter is overwhelming — galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, CMB anisotropies, and structure formation all require a non-baryonic, non-luminous matter component with $\Omega_c \approx 0.26$. See [[Cold Dark Matter]].

The Standard Model contains no particle that fits:
- **Neutrinos** are the only neutral, weakly interacting SM fermions, but they are too light and too fast (hot dark matter) to explain the observed structure formation
- All other SM particles are either unstable, charged, or otherwise excluded

This means dark matter, whatever it is, requires **physics beyond the Standard Model** (BSM). Leading candidates include:
- **WIMPs**: new heavy particles with weak-scale interactions (natural in SUSY or extra-dimension models)
- **Axions**: light pseudoscalar particles motivated by the [[Hierarchy Problem|strong CP problem]]
- **Sterile neutrinos**: right-handed neutrinos that interact only gravitationally
- **Dark photons / dark sectors**: entirely new gauge groups with their own particles

See [[Nature of Dark Matter]] for details on candidates and detection strategies, and [[The dark|Dark Matter and Dark Energy]] for the QFT perspective.

## Dark energy: the vacuum energy puzzle

In the [[Dark Energy|ΛCDM model]], dark energy is the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, contributing $\Omega_\Lambda \approx 0.69$. The simplest QFT interpretation is that $\Lambda$ is the **vacuum energy** of quantum fields.

The problem: the Standard Model predicts vacuum energy contributions from every field, and the naive estimate is:

$$\rho_{\text{vacuum}}^{\text{SM}} \sim \frac{m_{\text{cutoff}}^4}{16\pi^2}$$

Taking the cutoff at the Planck scale gives $\rho_{\text{vacuum}} \sim 10^{120} \times \rho_\Lambda^{\text{observed}}$. Even taking the cutoff at the electroweak scale gives $\rho_{\text{vacuum}} \sim 10^{55} \times \rho_\Lambda^{\text{observed}}$.

This **cosmological constant problem** is the worst quantitative disagreement between theory and observation in physics. The Standard Model by itself offers no resolution. See [[Nature of Dark Energy]].

## What the Standard Model does contribute

While the SM does not explain dark matter or dark energy, it is deeply intertwined with the dark sector through:

- **Thermal history**: in the early universe, any dark matter candidate was in thermal contact with SM particles. The relic abundance of WIMPs, for instance, is set by their annihilation cross section into SM particles.
- **Detection channels**: direct, indirect, and collider searches for dark matter all rely on dark matter coupling (however weakly) to SM fields.
- **Vacuum energy**: the SM's quantum fields *do* contribute to the vacuum energy — the question is why the total is so small.
- **Baryogenesis**: the SM provides some CP violation and electroweak dynamics relevant to the [[Baryon Asymmetry]], which is linked to the overall matter content.

## Implications for BSM physics

The dark sector provides some of the strongest motivations for new physics:
- Any dark matter model must extend the SM particle content
- Solving the cosmological constant problem may require a fundamentally new understanding of the vacuum
- The coincidence that $\Omega_m \sim \Omega_\Lambda$ today may point to a dynamical connection between the dark sector and known physics
