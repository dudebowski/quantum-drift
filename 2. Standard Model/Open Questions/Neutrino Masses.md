# Neutrino Masses

Neutrino oscillations — the observed phenomenon of neutrinos changing flavor as they propagate — prove that neutrinos have **nonzero masses**. This is the most concrete, experimentally established evidence for physics beyond the minimal [[Standard model of particle physics|Standard Model]], which originally assumed massless neutrinos.

## The evidence: neutrino oscillations

A neutrino produced as one flavor (e.g. $\nu_\mu$ from pion decay) can be detected as a different flavor (e.g. $\nu_\tau$) after traveling some distance. This quantum interference requires:
- The flavor eigenstates ($\nu_e$, $\nu_\mu$, $\nu_\tau$) to be **different** from the mass eigenstates ($\nu_1$, $\nu_2$, $\nu_3$)
- The mass eigenstates to have **different masses** (otherwise no phase difference accumulates)

The mixing is described by the PMNS matrix. See [[Flavor Mixing]].

### What oscillation experiments measure

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| $\Delta m_{21}^2$ (solar) | $7.5 \times 10^{-5}$ eV$^2$ | Solar + reactor (KamLAND) |
| $|\Delta m_{32}^2|$ (atmospheric) | $2.5 \times 10^{-3}$ eV$^2$ | Atmospheric + accelerator |
| $\theta_{12}$ | ~34° | Solar |
| $\theta_{23}$ | ~45° | Atmospheric |
| $\theta_{13}$ | ~8.5° | Reactor (Daya Bay, RENO) |

Oscillations measure mass-squared *differences*, not absolute masses. The lightest neutrino could be essentially massless.

## Why the SM needs extension

In the minimal Standard Model:
- Only **left-handed** neutrinos exist (as partners of charged leptons in $SU(2)_L$ doublets)
- There are no right-handed neutrinos
- Without a right-handed neutrino, one cannot write a Yukawa coupling to the Higgs, so neutrinos remain massless

Giving neutrinos mass requires extending the Standard Model. The main options are:

### Dirac masses
- Add right-handed neutrinos $\nu_R$ (singlets under the full SM gauge group)
- Write a standard Yukawa coupling: $y_\nu \bar{L} \tilde{\Phi} \nu_R$
- After EWSB: $m_\nu = y_\nu v / \sqrt{2}$
- Problem: $m_\nu \lesssim 0.1$ eV requires $y_\nu \lesssim 10^{-12}$ — unnaturally tiny compared to all other Yukawa couplings

### Majorana masses and the seesaw mechanism
- If neutrinos are their own antiparticles (**Majorana fermions**), a new mass term is possible: $M_R \bar{\nu}_R^c \nu_R$
- The **type-I seesaw**: add heavy right-handed neutrinos with a large Majorana mass $M_R$. The light neutrino mass becomes:

$$m_\nu \approx \frac{y_\nu^2 v^2}{2 M_R}$$

For $y_\nu \sim 1$ and $M_R \sim 10^{14}$ GeV, this gives $m_\nu \sim 0.01$ eV — naturally explaining why neutrino masses are so small.

- The seesaw mechanism also provides heavy right-handed neutrinos that can drive **leptogenesis**. See [[Baryon Asymmetry]].

### Other mechanisms
- **Type-II seesaw**: a scalar triplet gives neutrinos mass
- **Type-III seesaw**: fermionic triplets
- **Inverse seesaw**: lower-scale variants accessible to collider experiments
- **Radiative masses**: neutrino masses generated by loop diagrams involving new particles

## Dirac vs Majorana: how to tell

If neutrinos are Majorana particles, **neutrinoless double beta decay** ($0\nu\beta\beta$) becomes possible:

$$2n \to 2p + 2e^-$$

(no neutrinos emitted — lepton number violated by 2). Observing this process would prove neutrinos are Majorana and measure the "effective Majorana mass." Experiments: GERDA/LEGEND, KamLAND-Zen, EXO, CUPID, nEXO.

No signal has been observed so far; current limits constrain $|m_{\beta\beta}| \lesssim 0.04$–$0.16$ eV.

## Open questions

- **Absolute mass scale**: oscillations give $\Delta m^2$ but not the overall scale. Direct kinematic measurements (KATRIN) constrain $m_{\nu_e} < 0.45$ eV. Cosmology constrains $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.12$ eV.
- **Mass ordering**: is it "normal" ($m_1 < m_2 < m_3$) or "inverted" ($m_3 < m_1 < m_2$)? JUNO and DUNE aim to settle this.
- **Dirac or Majorana?** Neutrinoless double beta decay experiments are the key test.
- **CP violation in the lepton sector**: $\delta_{\text{CP}}$ in the PMNS matrix is under measurement by T2K, NOvA, and future DUNE.
- **Sterile neutrinos**: do additional, non-interacting neutrino species exist? Some anomalies suggest it, but the picture is unclear.
