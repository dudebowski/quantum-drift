# Quantum Gravity and the Standard Model

Gravity is the one fundamental force that the [[Standard model of particle physics|Standard Model]] does not include. General relativity describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime — a classical field theory, not a quantum one. Merging gravity with the quantum framework of the Standard Model remains one of the deepest open problems in physics.

## Why gravity is excluded

The Standard Model is a [[Quantum Field Theory]] on **flat** (Minkowski) spacetime. Gravitational effects are negligible at the energies where particle physics experiments operate:

$$\frac{F_{\text{gravity}}}{F_{\text{EM}}} \sim \frac{G_N m_p^2}{e^2/(4\pi\epsilon_0)} \sim 10^{-36}$$

For two protons, gravity is $10^{36}$ times weaker than electromagnetism. At collider energies (up to ~TeV), gravitational corrections are unmeasurably small, so ignoring gravity is an excellent practical approximation.

## The problem with quantising gravity

When one tries to treat gravity as a quantum field theory — quantising the metric perturbation $h_{\mu\nu}$ as a spin-2 field — the theory is **non-renormalizable**. Each order of perturbation theory introduces new types of divergences requiring new counterterms, and the theory loses predictive power at energies near the Planck scale:

$$E_{\text{Planck}} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c^5}{G_N}} \approx 1.2 \times 10^{19}\,\text{GeV}$$

This is $10^{15}$ times higher than LHC energies. The Standard Model plus classical gravity works as an **effective field theory** below the Planck scale, but a UV-complete quantum theory of gravity is needed at or above it.

See [[9. Notes/Quantum gravity|Cosmology and Quantum Gravity]] for the full discussion of approaches.

## Approaches to quantum gravity

### String theory
- Replaces point particles with 1-dimensional strings
- Naturally includes a massless spin-2 excitation (the graviton)
- Requires extra spatial dimensions (6 or 7)
- Can embed the Standard Model gauge group, but the landscape of possible vacua is vast
- No direct experimental predictions at accessible energies so far

### Loop quantum gravity
- Directly quantises the geometry of spacetime
- Predicts a discrete structure of space at the Planck scale (spin networks)
- Does not require extra dimensions or supersymmetry
- Recovers general relativity in the classical limit
- Struggles to naturally incorporate the Standard Model matter content

### Other approaches
- **Asymptotic safety**: gravity may be non-perturbatively renormalizable with a UV fixed point
- **Causal dynamical triangulations**: a lattice approach to quantum gravity
- **Emergent gravity**: spacetime and gravity arise from underlying quantum information or entropy

## The unification question

A deeper version of the problem: is there a single framework that unifies the Standard Model forces *with* gravity?

- **Grand Unified Theories (GUTs)**: merge $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ into a single gauge group (e.g. $SU(5)$, $SO(10)$) at ~$10^{16}$ GeV, but do not include gravity
- **Supergravity / superstrings**: attempt to include both unification and gravity via supersymmetry
- Near-convergence of [[Gauge Couplings]] at ~$10^{16}$ GeV is suggestive but not conclusive

## Where gravity and particle physics meet

Though gravity is negligible in collider experiments, it becomes essential in:
- **Cosmology**: the expansion of the universe, dark energy, inflation — see [[Standard model of cosmology|ΛCDM]]
- **Black holes**: quantum effects near singularities and the information paradox
- **The Planck scale**: where quantum gravitational effects should dominate
- **Dark energy**: the [[Nature of Dark Energy|cosmological constant problem]] is a clash between QFT vacuum energy and gravitational observations
