# The Baryon Asymmetry

The observable universe is made almost entirely of **matter** rather than antimatter. The [[Standard model of particle physics|Standard Model]] contains the qualitative ingredients for generating this asymmetry, but quantitatively falls short — the amount of CP violation and the nature of the electroweak phase transition in the SM appear insufficient to explain the observed matter-antimatter imbalance.

## The observation

- The universe contains about 1 baryon (proton or neutron) per $10^9$ photons: the baryon-to-photon ratio $\eta \approx 6 \times 10^{-10}$.
- Essentially no primordial antimatter is observed — no anti-galaxies, no gamma-ray signals from large-scale matter-antimatter annihilation.
- [[Big Bang Nucleosynthesis]] and the [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] independently measure the same $\eta$, confirming this is a cosmological fact, not a local fluctuation.

If the Big Bang produced equal amounts of matter and antimatter (as naively expected from the symmetry of the laws of physics), something must have generated a tiny excess of matter over antimatter before they annihilated.

## Sakharov conditions

In 1967, Andrei Sakharov identified three necessary conditions for generating a baryon asymmetry from a symmetric initial state:

1. **Baryon number violation**: processes that create more baryons than antibaryons
2. **C and CP violation**: matter and antimatter must behave differently under the relevant interactions
3. **Departure from thermal equilibrium**: otherwise, any asymmetry would be washed out by the inverse processes

All three must be satisfied simultaneously.

## What the Standard Model provides

### Baryon number violation
The SM has **electroweak sphalerons** — non-perturbative processes that violate baryon number ($B$) and lepton number ($L$) while conserving $B - L$. At high temperatures (above the electroweak phase transition), sphalerons are rapid and can convert a lepton asymmetry into a baryon asymmetry or vice versa.

Sakharov condition 1: satisfied (in principle).

### CP violation
The CKM matrix has a CP-violating phase that produces measurable matter-antimatter differences in kaon, $B$-meson, and $D$-meson decays. See [[Flavor Mixing]].

However, the amount of CP violation in the SM is **quantitatively tiny** — the Jarlskog invariant $J \approx 3 \times 10^{-5}$ — far too small to generate the observed $\eta \sim 10^{-10}$ through known electroweak processes.

Sakharov condition 2: qualitatively satisfied but quantitatively insufficient.

### Departure from equilibrium
This requires a **first-order** electroweak phase transition (a sudden, discontinuous transition as the universe cools through the electroweak scale). In the SM with $m_H \approx 125$ GeV, the electroweak transition is a smooth **crossover**, not a first-order transition.

Sakharov condition 3: **not satisfied** in the minimal SM.

## Beyond-SM baryogenesis scenarios

Since the SM falls short, the baryon asymmetry requires new physics. Leading scenarios include:

### Electroweak baryogenesis
- Extend the Higgs sector (e.g. two-Higgs-doublet models, singlet extensions) to make the electroweak phase transition first-order
- Add new sources of CP violation (e.g. from SUSY or extra scalars)
- Testable at the LHC and future colliders through Higgs coupling measurements and gravitational wave signatures

### Leptogenesis
- Generate a **lepton** asymmetry first, then convert it to a baryon asymmetry via sphalerons
- Heavy right-handed neutrinos (from the seesaw mechanism — see [[Neutrino Masses]]) decay asymmetrically in the early universe
- Naturally connected to the origin of neutrino masses
- Difficult to test directly because the right-handed neutrinos may be extremely heavy

### GUT baryogenesis
- Heavy gauge bosons or scalars in grand unified theories decay asymmetrically
- Requires baryon number violation from the GUT gauge group
- Constrained by proton decay limits

### Affleck-Dine mechanism
- A scalar field carrying baryon number acquires a large VEV during inflation, then its decay generates the asymmetry
- Natural in supersymmetric models
