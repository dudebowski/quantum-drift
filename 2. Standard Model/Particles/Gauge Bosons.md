# Gauge Bosons

The gauge bosons are the **force carriers** of the [[Standard model of particle physics|Standard Model]]. Each of the three fundamental forces is mediated by the exchange of gauge bosons, whose existence is required by [[Gauge Symmetry|local gauge invariance]].

## The gauge bosons

| Boson | Force | Gauge group | Spin | Mass | Electric charge |
|-------|-------|------------|------|------|----------------|
| Gluons ($g$, 8 types) | [[Strong Force]] | $SU(3)_C$ | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| Photon ($\gamma$) | [[Electromagnetic Force]] | $U(1)_{\text{EM}}$ | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| $W^\pm$ | [[Weak Force]] | $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ | 1 | 80.4 GeV | $\pm 1$ |
| $Z^0$ | [[Weak Force]] | $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ | 1 | 91.2 GeV | 0 |

All gauge bosons are spin-1 (vector) particles.

## Gluons

- Mediate the [[Strong Force]] between color-charged particles ([[Quarks]] and other gluons)
- There are **8 gluons**, corresponding to the 8 generators of $SU(3)_C$
- Gluons themselves carry color charge (one color and one anti-color), which means they **self-interact** — a distinctive feature of non-abelian gauge theories
- Gluon self-interaction is the origin of **confinement** (quarks and gluons are never seen free) and **asymptotic freedom** (the strong coupling weakens at high energies)
- Massless, but effectively confined to distances $\lesssim 1$ fm

## Photon

- Mediates the [[Electromagnetic Force]] between electrically charged particles
- The single generator of $U(1)_{\text{EM}}$ (after electroweak symmetry breaking)
- **Massless**: electromagnetic interactions are long-range ($\propto 1/r^2$)
- Does not self-interact (abelian gauge theory)
- The most precisely tested sector of the Standard Model: QED predictions match experiment to >10 significant figures

## $W^\pm$ bosons

- Mediate **charged-current** weak interactions: processes that change particle flavor
- Examples: beta decay ($n \to p + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$ via $d \to u + W^-$), muon decay ($\mu^- \to e^- + \bar{\nu}_e + \nu_\mu$)
- Carry electric charge ($\pm 1$), so they couple to photons as well
- Mass $m_W \approx 80.4$ GeV, acquired through the [[Higgs Mechanism]]
- The large mass makes the weak force **short-range** (~$10^{-18}$ m)
- Because they change quark flavors, $W$ interactions are governed by the **CKM matrix**. See [[Flavor Mixing]].

## $Z^0$ boson

- Mediates **neutral-current** weak interactions: processes that do not change flavor
- Examples: neutrino scattering ($\nu_\mu + e^- \to \nu_\mu + e^-$), $Z$-pole production at LEP
- Electrically neutral, but couples to both left- and right-handed fermions (with different strengths)
- Mass $m_Z \approx 91.2$ GeV, acquired through the [[Higgs Mechanism]]
- Precision measurements of $Z$ properties at LEP/SLC are among the strongest tests of the Standard Model

## Before and after electroweak symmetry breaking

Before the [[Higgs Mechanism]] breaks the electroweak symmetry, the gauge bosons of $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ are:
- $W^1, W^2, W^3$ (from $SU(2)_L$) — all massless
- $B$ (from $U(1)_Y$) — massless

After symmetry breaking, they mix:
- $W^\pm = (W^1 \mp i W^2)/\sqrt{2}$ — acquire mass
- $Z^0 = \cos\theta_W \, W^3 - \sin\theta_W \, B$ — acquires mass
- $\gamma = \sin\theta_W \, W^3 + \cos\theta_W \, B$ — stays massless

where $\theta_W \approx 28.7°$ is the **weak mixing angle** (Weinberg angle), a fundamental parameter relating the weak and electromagnetic couplings. See [[Gauge Couplings]].

## Predicted and discovered

The existence of the $W$ and $Z$ bosons was **predicted** by the electroweak theory of Glashow, Weinberg, and Salam in the 1960s–70s, and **discovered** at CERN's $Sp\bar{p}S$ collider in 1983. Their measured masses matched the predictions, confirming the electroweak theory and earning Rubbia and van der Meer the 1984 Nobel Prize.
