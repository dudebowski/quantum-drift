# Quarks

Quarks are the fundamental constituents of protons, neutrons, and all hadrons. They come in **six flavors** arranged in **three generations**, carry **color charge**, and interact via all three forces in the [[Standard model of particle physics|Standard Model]].

## The six flavors

| Generation | "Up-type" ($Q = +2/3$) | "Down-type" ($Q = -1/3$) |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------------|
| 1st | Up ($u$), ~2.2 MeV | Down ($d$), ~4.7 MeV |
| 2nd | Charm ($c$), ~1.27 GeV | Strange ($s$), ~96 MeV |
| 3rd | Top ($t$), ~173 GeV | Bottom ($b$), ~4.18 GeV |

Each generation is a heavier copy of the same pattern: one up-type quark with electric charge $+2/3$ and one down-type with charge $-1/3$. Ordinary matter is built entirely from 1st-generation quarks (up and down); heavier quarks are produced in high-energy collisions and decay rapidly.

The enormous mass hierarchy — from a few MeV (up) to 173 GeV (top) — is one of the unexplained features of the Standard Model. See [[Fermion Masses]] and [[Hierarchy Problem]].

## Color charge

Each quark carries one of three **color charges**: red, green, or blue. Color is the charge of the [[Strong Force]], analogous to electric charge for electromagnetism.

Key facts:
- Quarks interact via gluon exchange (the $SU(3)_C$ gauge interaction). See [[Gauge Symmetry]].
- Only **color-neutral** ("white") combinations are observed in nature — this is **confinement**:
  - **Baryons**: three quarks, one of each color ($rgb$) — e.g. proton ($uud$), neutron ($udd$)
  - **Mesons**: a quark-antiquark pair ($r\bar{r}$, etc.) — e.g. pion ($u\bar{d}$)
- Quarks have never been observed in isolation.

## Quantum numbers

Each quark carries multiple quantum numbers determined by its charges under the [[Gauge Symmetry]] group:

| Quantum number | Value | Gauge group |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| Color | $r, g, b$ | $SU(3)_C$ |
| Weak isospin (left-handed) | $+1/2$ (up-type), $-1/2$ (down-type) | $SU(2)_L$ |
| Hypercharge $Y$ | $+1/3$ (left), $+4/3$ or $-2/3$ (right) | $U(1)_Y$ |
| Electric charge $Q$ | $+2/3$ or $-1/3$ | $Q = T_3 + Y/2$ |
| Baryon number | $+1/3$ | (accidental symmetry) |

Left-handed quarks form $SU(2)_L$ doublets: $\begin{pmatrix} u \\ d \end{pmatrix}_L$, $\begin{pmatrix} c \\ s \end{pmatrix}_L$, $\begin{pmatrix} t \\ b \end{pmatrix}_L$.

Right-handed quarks are $SU(2)_L$ singlets — they do not participate in the [[Weak Force]] (except through mass mixing).

## Quark interactions

Quarks interact via all three Standard Model forces:
- **[[Strong Force]]**: gluon exchange between color-charged quarks (dominant)
- **[[Electromagnetic Force]]**: photon exchange (quarks have electric charge)
- **[[Weak Force]]**: $W^\pm$ and $Z^0$ exchange (flavor-changing processes like $d \to u + W^-$)

Flavor-changing interactions via the $W$ boson are governed by the **CKM matrix**. See [[Flavor Mixing]].

## The top quark

The top quark is special:
- At ~173 GeV, it is by far the heaviest known elementary particle — heavier than a gold atom
- Its Yukawa coupling to the Higgs is $y_t \approx 1$ (the only fermion with an order-one coupling)
- It decays before it can hadronise ($\tau_t \sim 5 \times 10^{-25}$ s), making it the only quark whose properties can be studied "bare"
