# Leptons

Leptons are fundamental fermions that do **not** carry color charge and therefore do not feel the [[Strong Force]]. Like [[Quarks|quarks]], they come in **three generations**, each containing a charged lepton and a neutrino. They are half of the matter content of the [[Standard model of particle physics|Standard Model]].

## The six leptons

| Generation | Charged lepton ($Q = -1$) | Neutrino ($Q = 0$) |
|-----------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| 1st | Electron ($e^-$), 0.511 MeV | Electron neutrino ($\nu_e$) |
| 2nd | Muon ($\mu^-$), 105.7 MeV | Muon neutrino ($\nu_\mu$) |
| 3rd | Tau ($\tau^-$), 1776.9 MeV | Tau neutrino ($\nu_\tau$) |

Each generation is a heavier copy: the muon is ~207 times heavier than the electron, and the tau is ~17 times heavier than the muon. As with quarks, the reason for three generations and the mass pattern is unexplained.

## Charged leptons

The electron, muon, and tau interact via:
- **[[Electromagnetic Force]]**: they carry electric charge $-1$
- **[[Weak Force]]**: they form left-handed doublets with their neutrinos

They do **not** participate in the [[Strong Force]] (no color charge).

The electron is stable (lightest charged lepton — nothing to decay into). The muon and tau are unstable:
- Muon: $\tau_\mu \approx 2.2 \,\mu$s, decays $\mu^- \to e^- + \bar{\nu}_e + \nu_\mu$
- Tau: $\tau_\tau \approx 2.9 \times 10^{-13}$ s, decays to lighter leptons or hadrons

### The electron $g-2$

The anomalous magnetic moment of the electron is one of the most precisely tested predictions in all of physics:

$$a_e = \frac{g-2}{2} = 0.001\,159\,652\,180\,73(28)$$

Theory and experiment agree to better than 1 part in $10^{10}$, a triumph of [[Quantum Field Theory]] and QED perturbation theory.

## Neutrinos

Neutrinos are electrically neutral, extremely light, and interact only via the [[Weak Force]] (and gravity). This makes them extraordinarily difficult to detect.

### Key properties
- In the original Standard Model, neutrinos were assumed massless. **Neutrino oscillation** experiments have shown they do have small but nonzero masses. See [[Neutrino Masses]].
- Only **left-handed** neutrinos (and right-handed antineutrinos) have been observed — whether right-handed neutrinos exist is an open question.
- Neutrinos come in three flavors ($\nu_e$, $\nu_\mu$, $\nu_\tau$), but the mass eigenstates are **mixtures** of these flavor states, described by the **PMNS matrix**. See [[Flavor Mixing]].

### Neutrinos in cosmology
Neutrinos play important roles beyond particle physics:
- They decoupled from the primordial plasma ~1 second after the Big Bang, forming the cosmic neutrino background. See [[Radiation and Neutrinos]].
- Their number of species $N_{\text{eff}}$ affects [[Big Bang Nucleosynthesis]] and the CMB.
- Their masses affect [[Large-Scale Structure|structure formation]] by free-streaming.

## Lepton number

Each generation has a conserved **lepton number** in the Standard Model:
- $L_e$, $L_\mu$, $L_\tau$ are individually conserved (in the minimal SM without neutrino masses)
- Neutrino oscillations violate individual lepton flavor numbers but conserve total lepton number $L$

Whether total lepton number is truly conserved is an open question — violation would occur if neutrinos are **Majorana** particles (their own antiparticles). See [[Neutrino Masses]].

## Quantum numbers

Left-handed leptons form $SU(2)_L$ doublets:

$$\begin{pmatrix} \nu_e \\ e^- \end{pmatrix}_L, \quad \begin{pmatrix} \nu_\mu \\ \mu^- \end{pmatrix}_L, \quad \begin{pmatrix} \nu_\tau \\ \tau^- \end{pmatrix}_L$$

Right-handed charged leptons ($e_R^-$, $\mu_R^-$, $\tau_R^-$) are $SU(2)_L$ singlets.

| Quantum number | Charged lepton | Neutrino |
|---------------|---------------|---------|
| Electric charge $Q$ | $-1$ | $0$ |
| Weak isospin $T_3$ (left) | $-1/2$ | $+1/2$ |
| Hypercharge $Y$ (left) | $-1$ | $-1$ |
| Color | none | none |
