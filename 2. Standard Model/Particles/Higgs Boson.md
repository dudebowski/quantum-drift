# The Higgs Boson

The Higgs boson is the only fundamental scalar (spin-0) particle in the [[Standard model of particle physics|Standard Model]]. It is the quantum excitation of the Higgs field — the field responsible for [[Higgs Mechanism|electroweak symmetry breaking]] and mass generation. Its discovery at the LHC in 2012 was the final confirmation of the Standard Model's particle content.

## Discovery

On 4 July 2012, the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN's Large Hadron Collider independently announced the discovery of a new boson with mass ~125 GeV, consistent with the long-predicted Higgs boson. The discovery channels were:
- $H \to \gamma\gamma$ (two photons)
- $H \to ZZ^* \to 4\ell$ (four leptons)
- $H \to WW^* \to \ell\nu\ell\nu$

Peter Higgs and Fran\c{c}ois Englert were awarded the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics for their theoretical prediction of the mechanism.

## Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Mass | $125.25 \pm 0.17$ GeV |
| Spin | 0 |
| Parity | $+1$ (scalar, not pseudoscalar) |
| Electric charge | 0 |
| Color charge | none |
| Width | ~4.1 MeV (very narrow) |
| Lifetime | ~$1.6 \times 10^{-22}$ s |

## How it couples

The Higgs boson couples to every massive particle in the Standard Model, with a coupling strength proportional to the particle's mass:

$$g_{Hff} \propto \frac{m_f}{v}, \qquad g_{HVV} \propto \frac{m_V^2}{v}$$

where $v \approx 246$ GeV is the Higgs vacuum expectation value. This means:
- The Higgs couples most strongly to the **top quark** ($y_t \approx 1$)
- It couples more weakly to lighter particles
- It does not couple directly to massless particles (photon, gluon) — but can interact with them via quantum loops

This mass-proportional coupling is a **prediction** of the [[Higgs Mechanism]] and has been confirmed experimentally for the $W$, $Z$, top, bottom, tau, and muon.

## Production and decay

### Production at the LHC
- **Gluon-gluon fusion** ($gg \to H$, via top-quark loop): dominant mode (~87%)
- **Vector boson fusion** ($qq \to qqH$): second largest (~7%)
- **Associated production** ($WH$, $ZH$, $t\bar{t}H$): smaller but important for measuring specific couplings

### Decay channels

| Channel | Branching ratio | Status |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| $H \to b\bar{b}$ | ~58% | Observed |
| $H \to WW^*$ | ~21% | Observed |
| $H \to gg$ | ~8.2% | (via loop) |
| $H \to \tau^+\tau^-$ | ~6.3% | Observed |
| $H \to c\bar{c}$ | ~2.9% | Under study |
| $H \to ZZ^*$ | ~2.6% | Observed (discovery channel) |
| $H \to \gamma\gamma$ | ~0.23% | Observed (discovery channel) |
| $H \to \mu^+\mu^-$ | ~0.022% | Evidence reported |

The $\gamma\gamma$ and $4\ell$ channels, though rare, are the cleanest experimentally because they can be fully reconstructed.

## What remains to measure

While the Higgs boson has been found, several of its properties are still being pinned down:

- **Higgs self-coupling**: the Higgs potential predicts the Higgs interacts with itself. Measuring this (via di-Higgs production $HH$) would directly probe the shape of the potential. This is a major goal of the HL-LHC and future colliders. See [[Higgs Parameters]].
- **Coupling to light fermions**: electron and light-quark couplings are too small to measure at the LHC.
- **Exotic decays**: any unexpected decay channels would signal physics beyond the Standard Model.
- **CP properties**: is the Higgs purely CP-even ($0^+$), or is there a CP-odd ($0^-$) admixture?

## The Higgs and the vacuum

The Higgs field's VEV ($v \approx 246$ GeV) sets the electroweak scale. A deep question is whether this vacuum is **stable**, **metastable**, or **unstable**. Current measurements of $m_H$ and $m_t$ suggest the electroweak vacuum is **metastable** — it could in principle tunnel to a lower-energy state, though the lifetime is enormously longer than the age of the universe.
